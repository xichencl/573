The Food and Drug\nAdministration published a report on its Web site on Tuesday by a\nstaff researcher, concluding that more than 27,000 deaths could be\nattributed to Vioxx based on comparisons with how patients taking\nother painkillers had fared.\n", "\nOn Thursday, the Lancet, a respected British medical journal,\npublished an analysis of all the clinical trials of Vioxx completed\nby 2001, and concluded that Merck and the FDA should have known\nenough about the drug's hazards to withdraw it years ago.\n", "\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers plan to compare notes next week on the types\nof clients who may make the strongest cases, with a premium on people\nwho were in demonstrably good health before taking Vioxx.\n", "\nThe group also intends to discuss ways to cooperate in gathering\nevidence and expert testimony, and in devising tactics to influence\nwhere the bulk of the cases may end up, as state and federal judges\nconsolidate them. Until such matters are resolved, how soon any of\nthe cases may come to trial is uncertain, including one that had been\nexpected to begin as early as next month in federal court in\nBirmingham, Ala.\n", "\nMany lawyers will also be jockeying for roles that will maximize\ntheir influence, and ultimately their reimbursement, as the\nlitigation unfolds.\n", "\nMore than 20 million Americans have used Vioxx since it went on the\nmarket in 1999. Millions more used the drug overseas. Based on the\nnumber of Vioxx customers and the seriousness of the injuries, the\nVioxx lawsuits would appear to have the potential to dwarf recent\ncases like the one against Baycol, a cholesterol-lowering drug used\nby about 700,000 Americans, and the one against the diet supplement\nfen-phen, which an estimated 6 million people took.\n", "\nBaycol's maker, the Bayer Group of Germany, said in late September\nthat it had paid $1.09 billion to settle 2,861 lawsuits and that\n7,577 suits were pending. And Wyeth, the marketer of fen-phen, faces\ncontinuing legal battles with plaintiffs who opted out of a\nsettlement program that pays victims from a $3.75 billion trust fund.\nWyeth has set aside $16.6 billion to cover its liabilities.\n", "\nMany plaintiffs' lawyers say it is too early to make a realistic\nassessment of Merck's financial vulnerability. Merck, the nation's\nsecond-largest drugmaker, has long been among the nation's strongest\ncompanies financially, with a credit rating among the highest in\nAmerican business.\n", "\nIn their meetings next week, the lawyers are likely to weigh the\npotential impact of this week's national elections, which\nstrengthened the Republican-led effort to curb product liability\nlawsuits. A related concern for the plaintiffs' lawyers is the FDA's\ncontinuing efforts under the Bush administration to persuade judges\nthat FDA approval of a drug, along with warnings on the label, should\ngo a long way toward shielding the maker from lawsuits.\n", "\nSo far, most state judges have rejected the FDA immunity argument.\nBut if courts began to accept it -- or Congress made it the law of\nthe land -- plaintiffs' lawyers would have the higher hurdle of\narguing that Merck deceived the FDA by hiding or distorting damaging\ndata. That case would be hard to make without supportive testimony\nfrom the agency, some lawyers said.\n", "\nThe personal injury lawsuits -- or tort cases, as lawyers call them\n-- can be filed in state or federal courts and in many cases name\nother parties, like doctors or drug distributor, as co-defendants\nwith Merck.\n", "\nIn the hundreds of Vioxx lawsuits filed before Merck took the drug\noff the market, the action was primarily in New Jersey, where Merck\nis based, and the big states of Texas and California. But the\nfinancial burden of taking on a giant like Merck while it continued\nto insist that Vioxx was safe and effective scared away many lawyers.\n", "\n\"It's been a quiet little mass tort for a long time,\" said Carlene\nRhodes Lewis, a Houston lawyer whose firm was among the pioneers when\nit began filing Vioxx complaints in 2001. Lewis and her partners took\non nearly 300 such cases by the time Merck pulled the plug on Vioxx.\n", "\nMerck's withdrawal of Vioxx has made it much easier for lawyers to\nargue to a jury that the product should not have been on the market.\nBut proving liability could still be difficult.\n", "\nThe data from clinical studies suggest, so far, that the most serious\nhealth problems hit patients who had used Vioxx for 18 months or\nlonger. Merck has said it does not know yet how large that group is.\n", "\nIn addition, many possible Vioxx victims may find it difficult to pin\ntheir health problems on the drug if forced to go to trial, lawyers\nwho filed the early cases said. The injuries linked to Vioxx are also\ncommon among people who have not used the drug, and they have many\ncauses.\n", "\n\"The person who should never have taken Vioxx and should have been\nwarned by Merck, the person with multiple risks of cardiac problems,\nmay not make the best client, because it may be harder to prove that\nVioxx caused the heart attack,\" said Cynthia Anne Solomon, a lawyer\nin Mt. Pleasant, S.C.\n", "\nAs a result, the pioneering plaintiffs' lawyers in the Vioxx\nlitigation have been carefully screening potential clients in search\nof those who were relatively healthy before they took the drug and\nsuffered injuries. Some of those lawyers said they were worried that\nlawyers who rushed into the field after Merck withdrew the drug,\nincluding law firms soliciting clients with radio and print\nadvertising, will muddy the legal landscape with questionable claims.\n", "\n\"For every hundred calls we get, there are only two or three top-end\ncases,\" Papantonio said.\n", "\nHe and others said that Merck, if it follows the course of other drug\ncompanies in similar situations, is likely to try to settle the\nstrongest cases against it and fight some of the weaker claims in\ntrials. If it wins those trials, it could knock down the settlement\nvalue of the vast majority of claims against it and cut billions of\ndollars from its potential exposure.\n", "\nMerck recently asked the panel of judges that supervises the way mass\ntorts are handled in federal courts to assign all of the lawsuits to\none judge. Becnel filed a similar petition.\n", "\nThe panel is expected to hear arguments on the petitions and where\nthe cases should be consolidated at its January meeting.\n", "\nMany lawyers involved in the lawsuits say the federal consolidation\nprocess should hasten final settlement of most of the Vioxx cases.\nThe state cases in New Jersey and California have already gone\nthrough such a process.\n", "\nBut the effort to centralize the federal cases while sorting out\nwhich cases will remain in state courts -- where plaintiffs' lawyers\nusually prefer them -- could very likely lead to procedure battles\nthat may delay the first Vioxx trials. Several were on course to\nbegin in the next few months.\n", "\n\"It's up in air now,\" said Andy D.

I came to realize,'' Friedan later wrote, ``that something\nis very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their\nlives today. . . .For the startling pattern that began to emerge as\none clue led me to another in far-flung fields of modern thought and\nlife, defied not only the conventional image but basic psychological\nassumptions about women.''\n", "\nShe found that books on the psychology of women generally adhered\nto traditional ideas of women's fulfillment in hearth and home.\nSeeking a theoretical basis for her views of women's plight, Friedan\nturned to the work on identity and self realization by psychologists\nincluding Abraham Maslow and Erik Erikson. Their ideas informed what\nbecame her central tenet: ``that the core of the problem for women\ntoday is . . . a problem of identity -- a stunting or evasion of\ngrowth that is perpetuated by the feminine mystique.''\n", "\nFriedan finally produced a 1,000-page manuscript. It took her five\nyears.\n", "\nFriedan's publisher, W. W. Norton, printed only a few thousand\nhardcover copies in 1963. Friedan did not experience the full force of\nfame until Dell issued the paperback in 1964. That year, ``The\nFeminine Mystique'' became the top-selling nonfiction book in the\ncountry. Much of the initial reaction was not favorable. Friedan was\ncursed, told to seek psychiatric help and accused of posing ``more of\na threat to the United States than the Russians.'' She was shunned by\nneighborhood women, her children were kicked out of car pools, and her\nmarriage began to crack under the weight of her growing celebrity.\n", "\nTo many black women more concerned with survival than\nself-fulfillment, Friedan's call to women to find meaningful careers\n``seemed to come from another planet,'' according to historian Paula\nGiddings.\n", "\nThe personal narrative that gave ``Feminine Mystique'' much of its\npower was misleading in another way: It omitted references to\nFriedan's earlier career as a left-wing journalist, creating the\nimpression that the author had never been anything other than a\nsuburban matron.\n", "\nYears later, biographer Daniel Horowitz would accuse Friedan of\nobscuring her past to sell books. But Friedan insisted she was only\nbeing politically savvy. ``It was the McCarthy era . . . and I didn't\ngo around parading my left-wing background because it wouldn't have\nhelped in organizing the women's movement,'' she told the Los Angeles\nTimes a few years ago. ``On the other hand, I never kept it secret.''\n", "\n``The Feminine Mystique'' was so astute in its analysis that, as\nfuturist Alvin Toffler said, it ``pulled the trigger on history.'' The\nbook launched a tumultuous decade for American women, with Friedan at\nthe epicenter.\n", "\nIn June 1966, Friedan joined members of state commissions on the\nstatus of women for a national conference in Washington, D.C. Four\nmonths later, they reconvened and Friedan was elected president of the\nnascent National Organization for Women.\n", "\nAmong its signature success was lobbying President Lyndon Johnson\nto sign an Executive Order prohibiting sex discrimination by federal\ncontractors.\n", "\nToday, the group is anchored in Washington, D.C., and has 500,000\nmembers and branches in all 50 states. But in its early years, NOW's\nheadquarters was Friedan's New York City apartment and Friedan was\nindisputably in charge.\n", "\nIn 1970, the largest feminist demonstration since the suffrage\nmovement took over Fifth Avenue when Friedan called for a national\nWomen's Strike for Equality. Held on the 50th anniversary of the\npassage of the women's suffrage amendment, it drew 500,000 women.\n", "\nBut during these heady years, Friedan's marriage was crumbling. She\nclaimed years later to have been a battered wife, a contention that\noutraged Carl Friedan, who vociferously denied the charges. Their\n22-year marriage ended in divorce in 1969.\n", "\nIn 1970, Friedan would step down as NOW president amid growing\ndissatisfaction with her vision of the movement. But not even her\ncritics could deny the power of the changes she had unleashed.\n", "\nBy this time the mother of the movement was being assaulted by its\nmore radical elements. In 1969 she had delivered her first public\nattack on lesbianism, labeling it a ``lavender menace'' that would\ntarnish the entire feminist agenda. Enraged, many lesbians quit NOW.\n", "\nBy the end of the 1970s, Friedan was relegated to the sidelines of\nthe movement she had inspired. She was dismayed not only by its\ndirection but what she saw as its mounting toll and the growing\npolitical backlash. As she saw it, the movement had burdened rather\nthan liberated women, burning out those who were trying to juggle\nmotherhood and career or penetrate the corporate glass ceiling.\nMoreover, she observed, women in lower-level jobs were still earning\nonly 59 cents to every dollar earned by men -- this after almost two\ndecades of renewed feminist activism.\n", "\nFriedan's response was ``The Second Stage,'' published in 1981. The\nmovement's senior theorist always had insisted that men were not the\nenemy. In her new book, startlingly, she suggested that the enemy was\nthe victim herself.\n", "\n``I believe we have to break through our own feminist mystique,''\nFriedan wrote, arguing that, ``The equality we fought for isn't\nlivable, isn't workable, isn't comfortable in the terms that\nstructured our battle.'' Feminists, she charged, had fallen into a new\ntrap ``which denied that core of women's personhood that is fulfilled\nthrough love, nurture, home. . . .\n", "\nCalling the feminist foremother ''hopelessly confused about whose\nside she's on,`` theorist Ellen Willis wrote that Friedan ''would\ndestroy feminism in order to save it, and beat the Moral Majority by\njoining it.`` Journalist Susan Faludi, writing in her 1991 book\n''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,`` said Friedan\nwas ''yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork.``\n", "\nFriedan began to turn her focus to other issues. She received a\ncall from the head of the National Institute on Aging, asking her to\nbecome an advocate for older Americans. She at first fought the idea,\n''locked in denial`` about the encroaching reality of her own aging --\nshe was approaching 60 and hating it. What changed her mind was\nremembering conversations she'd had with older women while researching\n''The Feminine Mystique.`` The healthiest and most vital women she\ninterviewed had been older women -- in their 50s and 60s -- who had\ncareers.\n", "\nIn 1993 she published ''The Fountain of Age,`` a book in which she\nagain challenged the prevailing stereotypes and argued that an active,\nengaged life was the secret to a good old age. The book earned mixed\nreviews, with some critics faulting her for presenting an overly\noptimistic view of the stage of life Friedan herself was experiencing.\n", "\n(End optional trim)\n", "\nIn her last years, Friedan split her time between homes in Sag\nHarbor, N.Y., and Washington, D.C. She spent more time with her\nchildren -- Daniel, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University who\nwon a MacArthur Foundation genius grant; Jonathan, an engineer in\nPhiladelphia; and Emily, a pediatrician in Buffalo, N.Y. -- and their\nfamilies.\n", "\nFriedan wrote six books and had teaching posts at many\ninstitutions, including Yale, Harvard, the University of California,\nLos Angeles and the University of Southern California. Surgery in 1997\nto replace an infected aortic valve slowed her down only a little. A\nfew years later, she was a distinguished visiting professor at Cornell\nUniversity, where she used a $1 million Ford Foundation grant to\nconduct a three-year study on women, men, work, family and public\npolicy.\n", "\nShe continued to deplore the lack of progress on issues that\naffected the quality of family life, such as flexible scheduling and\nbetter and more affordable child care.\n", "\nYet she seemed to look back on her life with immense pleasure,\nsaying that the women's movement had succeeded in the United States\nand other advanced countries beyond her wildest imaginings.\n", "\n''I thought once,`` she said, ''about what should be put on my\ngravestone: `She helped make women feel better about being women and\ntherefore better able to freely and fully love men.' ``\n"], "LTW_ENG_20050606.0060": ["\n", "\nI try very, very hard not to think of the conservative movement as\na gaggle of thick-skulled fanatics.

In 1974 the writer and\nactivist Robin Morgan had put it most starkly: \"Pornography is\nthe theory, rape is the practice.\"\n", "\nMacKinnon and Dworkin's antipornography statutes-which passed in Indianapolis and Bellingham, Wash.,\nand were defeated in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Cambridge-made little\nuse of obscenity standards and instead reframed the issue as\none of sex discrimination. While their bills didn't ban porn\noutright, they allowed women to sue pornographers for damages.\n", "\nAnd those damages, the anti-porn feminists argued, weren't merely abstract. During\nthe debates over the local ordinances, and in testimony before\nEdwin Meese's Commission on Pornography in 1985, MacKinnon and others\narranged for often horrifying testimony by women on the physical\nand mental abuse they had suffered either in the making\nof pornography or at the hands of men they claimed\nhad been inspired by it. Some of the most dramatic\ntestimony was from Linda Lovelace, star of \"Deep Throat.\"\n", "\nSo what happened to those voices? Now a law professor at\nthe University of Michigan, MacKinnon has a new book out\nthis month, \"Women's Lives, Men's Laws\" (Belknap), which includes essays\nand speeches on pornography, but in recent years she and\nDworkin seem to have lost not just the legal battle\nbut the cultural war. These days, \"sex-positive\" feminists like Laura\nKipnis or Camille Paglia tend to get the airtime. And\nin the universities, women's studies scholars are more likely to\ndo close readings of the aesthetics and politics of pornography\nthan to march in favor of banning it.\n", "\nEven at the time, MacKinnon and Dworkin's campaign sharply split the\nfeminist movement. While supported by leading figures like Steinem and\nBrownmiller, the Indianapolis law in particular galvanized others in opposition.\nThey formed the Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce, or FACT. When the\nlaw's constitutionality was being decided by a federal appeals court,\nFACT submitted an amicus brief-signed by Betty Friedan, Rita Mae\nBrown, Kate Millet, Adrienne Rich and others-opposing it.\n", "\nTorn between the conflicting arguments, the National Organization of Women was\nunable to take a position. MacKinnon's description of her opponents,\nin a 1987 speech, was typical of the heated rhetoric:\n\"The Black movement has Uncle Toms and Oreo cookies. The\nlabor movement had scabs. The women's movement has FACT.\"\n", "\nStarting in the late 1980s some feminist scholars also began to\nsee porn as a tool that women could appropriate to\nliberate themselves from patriarchal norms of behavior and beauty. Porn\nsexuality, they argued, wasn't simply about subjugation. Instead, \"what pornography\nis trying to do is create, using real bodies, a\nfantasy of a kind of idealized and perfectly abundant pleasure,\"\nsays Linda Williams, a film studies professor at the University\nof California, Berkeley, and a leading porn theorist. What others\nmight see as basically a masturbatory aid was cast instead\nas a genre of utopian social criticism. As for the\nanti-porn crusaders, Williams adds: \"Really, who are they to tell\nus where our sexual imaginations should go?\"\n", "\nSo it was a deeply divided feminist movement that faced the\nfailure of MacKinnon and Dworkin's laws, not only in places\nlike Los Angeles and Cambridge, but when they were eventually\nstruck down by federal courts in both Indiana and Washington.\nAs Joshua Cohen, an MIT political science professor who has\nstudied the First Amendment ramifications of the laws, puts it,\n\"A lot of the energy that went into the issue\nduring the 1980s was focused on these legal strategies.\" When\nthey failed, he says, \"It became pretty clear that legal\nregulations directed to stop pornography were not going to be\naccepted by the courts, and that probably sapped some of\nthe energy from the anti-pornography movement.\"\n", "\nEven where they did survive, the laws had unintended and often\ncrudely ironic consequences. In Canada, which in 1992 adopted MacKinnon\nand Dworkin's definition of pornography, it was used largely to\nprosecute gay and lesbian bookstores and even to seize copies\nof two of Dworkin's books because they \"illegally eroticized pain\nand bondage.\"\n", "\nToday, Mackinnon bristles at the old charge that anti-porn feminists were,\nin effect, in bed with the political right. \"I actually\nknow who I'm in bed with,\" she said in a\nrecent interview. \"This was just something created by the pornographers\nto scare liberals off, which doesn't take much.\"\n", "\nBut her language has been adopted by some on the right.\nNow, according to Janet LaRue of Concerned Women for America,\n\"It may be that we're not hearing as much from\nthe traditional hardline feminist organizations, but when I write and\nspeak on the topic of pornography, one of the aspects\nthat I point out is that it certainly subjugates and\ndegrades women and reduces us to the sum or our\nbody parts.\"\n", "\nBut perhaps it's porn's very ubiquity that has most weakened the\nanti-pornography case, feminist and conservative. Thanks to the growth of\nhome-video pornography in the 1980s and the more recent shift\nto the Internet, far more people have access to X-rated\nmaterial than ever before. As Williams puts it, \"In a\nway I think MacKinnon and Dworkin were able to invoke\nthe kind of horror that they did at pornography at\na time when not as many people had seen it.\nFor better or for worse, now it has become part\nof the vernacular of our way of talking about picturing\nsex to ourselves.\"\n", "\nMacKinnon agrees, though she sees the shift as more insidious: \"The\ndata just show that pornography sets community standards, so the\nmore pornography there is, the less will be seen to\nbe wrong with it. It's just its own intrinsic dynamic.\"\n", "\nDespite the recent backlash against television indecency, pornography prosecutions remain rare.\nThe Bush administration has picked up the pace from the\nClinton administration, creating a special anti-porn unit in the Department\nof Justice and hiring Bruce Taylor, the prosecutor who went\nafter Larry Flynt in 1981, as its porn czar. Last\nmonth, the Justice Department announced that it would appeal a\nrecent decision by a federal judge that declared federal obscenity\nlaws unconstitutional. And speaking earlier this week, the new attorney\ngeneral, Alberto Gonzales, listed \"the aggressive prosecution of purveyors of\nobscene materials\" among his top priorities.\n", "\nStill, Frederick Schauer, a First Amendment scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School\nof Government, points out that \"criminal obscenity prosecutions have come\nclose to disappearing, they're constitutionally permissible but almost nonexistent.... The\nlegal definition of obscenity remains very, very, very narrow.\"\n", "\nAs for MacKinnon, since the early 1990s she has focused on\ninternational issues like prostitution, human trafficking, and war crimes. (In\n2000, she won a war crimes conviction against the Bosnian\nSerb leader Radovan Karadzic for the rape of Muslim and\nCroat women during the Bosnian War.) But she says pornography\nis still a central issue for her.\n", "\n\"Until a problem is solved, it's always a good time to\nsolve it,\" she says. \"Whether people want to solve it\nis another question.\"\n", "\nDrake Bennett is the staff writer for Ideas.

And the CIA says Khan sold\nnuclear materials to North Korea.\n", "\nAt a minimum, Khan provided a turn-key nuclear bomb program to\nLibya, while greatly speeding up the nuclear program of Iran,\na country that sponsors terrorist organizations.\n", "\n\"Iran wouldn't be talking about getting nuclear weapons if it hadn't\nbeen for Khan,\" said David Albright, a leading nuclear expert\nand president of the Institute for Science and International Security,\na non-proliferation think-tank.\n", "\nKhan's centrifuge designs are particularly important to covert nuclear programs because\nthey allow the development of bomb-making material with greater secrecy,\ncompared with the gaseous diffusion method of producing U-235.\n", "\n\"Centrifuge enrichment is much less energy-and-time consuming than gaseous diffusion, and\nyou can hide it a lot easier,\" said Henry Sokolski,\nexecutive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington,\nD.C.\n", "\nU.S. intelligence and the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency are\ntrying to determine whether A.

Although they were subsequently\nreleased, the CIA now believes that one of the scientists\n\"may have provided some assistance to al-Qaida's program\" to acquire\nnuclear weaponry, the spy agency said in the recent report\nto Congress.\n", "\nBased on documents recovered in Afghanistan, the agency described al-Qaida's atomic\nefforts \"rudimentary nuclear research, although the extent of its indigenous\nprogram is unclear.\"\n", "\nInvestigators are also trying to determine the extent of the Khan\nnetwork and all of the companies around the globe that\nmay have played a part. There are at least 30\ncompanies in 30 countries \"all over the globe involved in\nthis fantastic, sophisticated, illicit trafficking network with Mr. A.Q. Khan\nacting as CEO,\" according to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of\nthe IAEA.\n", "\nMajor elements of Khan's network have been uncovered in Malaysia and\nSouth Africa. Malaysian police arrested a Sri Lankan businessman --\nBukhary Syed Abu Tahir -- who admitted shipping nuclear components\nto Iran and Libya at Khan's behest. Tahir also admitted\nreceiving two briefcases containing $3 million in cash from Iran\nin exchange for providing nuclear weapons material.\n", "\nIn South Africa, authorities are investigating the sale of nuclear weapons\ntechnology to Libya through middlemen tied to Khan. Three individuals\nallegedly tied to the Khan network, including European nationals, were\narrested as part of the South African investigation.\n", "\nKhan, the one person who could provide answers to the many\npending questions, is out of reach of the IAEA and\nU.S. intelligence agencies. Pakistan has refused to allow intelligence officers\nto talk to Khan, while offering to relay written questions\nto him. The problem with that arrangement is that investigators\ncan't be sure whether it's Khan -- or someone else\n-- answering the questions.\n", "\nNonetheless, a Vienna-based diplomat says the Pakistanis have been cooperative with\nU.S. and IAEA officials about disclosing what their investigators have\nuncovered concerning Khan's operations. Cooperation between Pakistani government and the\nU.S. and IAEA \"has moved slowly but positively,\" he said.\n", "\nThe IAEA wants to meet with Tahir, the Sri Lankan businessman\ncurrently in a Malaysian jail, to help officials frame better\nquestions to Khan, the diplomat said. In addition, the IAEA\nhas requested permission from Islamabad to send its investigators to\nexamine Pakistan's uranium centrifuges. By comparing the Pakistan models with\nthose in Iran, the IAEA can conclusively determine whether Iran's\ncentrifuges originated in Pakistan.\n", "\nGiven that the Pakistan military, headed by Gen.

Probably not,\" he\nsaid.\n", "\nOakley added that Khan's illicit export network wasn't a new creation\nbut rather reversed the flow of information and material on\nthe import network that Khan and the Pakistan military had\nused to acquire nuclear materials for their country's atomic program.\n", "\nThe assumption among some informed diplomats and intelligence officials is that,\nat a minimum, Khan must have had help from other\nsenior scientists in the Pakistani government.\n", "\n\"Khan is a metallurgist, so he understood well about building centrifuges,\"\na Vienna-based diplomat said. \"But he wouldn't necessarily understand bomb\ndesigns nor would he understand uranium conversion and the many\nother technologies involved.\"\n", "\nThe Bush administration, always working to build-up Musharraf, has accepted his\nclaims of innocence.\n", "\nSecretary of State Powell said that when he asked Musharraf if\nhe had known about Khan's work, the general denied any\nknowledge.\n", "\nKhan's nuclear network \"was so compartmented within government circles\" and Musharraf\nwas \"outside the circle,\" Powell said of Musharraf's explanation. \"That's\nwhat he has said to me, and I have no\nevidence to prove or disprove his statement.\"\n", "\nAll of which leads to the question of motive, another major\nthrust in the IAEA investigation. While Khan profited financially from\nthe sale of nuclear secrets, money likely was not the\nsole motivation.\n", "\nThe IAEA's ElBaradei has said that \"ideology\" also played a factor.\n", "\nFor example, Hassan Abbas, the former Pakistani security official, said Khan\nmay have been motivated by the strategic view held by\nsome Pakistani military leaders that spreading nuclear technology was a\nway to counter U.S. power and what Islamabad fears is\nan emerging alliance among India, the United States and Israel.\n", "\nWhile Khan is not a religious extremist like bin Laden, he\nmay also have been motivated by a pan-Muslim view of\nspreading weapons to guarantee the influence of Muslim countries.\n", "\n\"Khan was motivated by some element of ideology, greed and convoluted\nstrategic thinking,\" said Haqqani, the former Pakistani diplomat.\n", "\nAnother likely motivation is Khan's ample ego, said Oakley. \"It may\nbe a little of, 'Look at me.

As a result, much of the\nurgency has been sapped from the investigation, helping keep hidden\nthe full dimensions of the activities of Khan and his associates.\n", "\nThere is no shortage of tantalizing leads. U.S. intelligence\nofficials and the IAEA, working separately, are still untangling\nKhan's travels in the years before his arrest.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n", "\nA POTENTIAL DANGER\n", "\nA.Q. Khan may have been unknown to most Americans when he was\nrevealed about a year ago as the mastermind of the largest illicit\nnuclear proliferation network in history. But for three decades Khan,\na metallurgist, has been well known to British and U.S. intelligence\nofficials. Even so, the United States and its allies passed up\nopportunities to stop him -- and apparently failed to detect that he\nhad begun selling nuclear technology to Iran in the late 1980s. It\nwas the opening transaction for an enterprise that eventually spread\nto North Korea, Libya and beyond.\n", "\nKhan studied in Pakistan and Europe. After he secured a job in the\nNetherlands in the early 1970s at a plant making centrifuges -- the\ndevices that purify uranium -- Dutch intelligence officials began\nwatching him. By late 1975, they grew so wary, after he was observed\nat a nuclear trade show in Switzerland asking suspicious questions,\nthat they moved him to a different area of the company to keep him\naway from uranium enrichment work.\n", "\n\"There was an awareness,\" said Frank Slijper of the Dutch Campaign\nagainst Arms Trade, who recently wrote a report on Khan's early days,\n\"that he was a potential danger.\"\n", "\nKhan suddenly left the country that December, called home by his\ngovernment for its atomic project. Years later, investigators\ndiscovered that he had taken blueprints for the centrifuges with him.\nIn Pakistan, Khan was working to develop a bomb to counter India's,\nand Washington was intent on stopping the project.\n", "\nIt later proved to be the first of several occasions when the United\nStates failed to fully understand what Khan was up to.\n", "\nJoseph Nye, a Harvard professor who has served in several\nadministrations, said U.S. intelligence agencies thought Pakistan\nwould try to make its bomb by producing plutonium -- an alternative\nbomb fuel. Nye was sent to France to halt the shipment of technology\nthat would have enabled Pakistan to complete a reprocessing plant for\nthe plutonium fuel. \"We returned to Washington to celebrate our\nvictory, only to discover that Khan had already stolen the technology\nfor another path to the bomb,\" Nye recalled.\n", "\nTo gather more atomic gear and skill, Khan returned to the\nNetherlands repeatedly. But the United States wanted to watch him,\nand a European diplomat with wide knowledge of nuclear intelligence\ncited the two occasions when the CIA persuaded the Dutch authorities\nnot to arrest him. Intelligence officials apparently felt Khan was\nmore valuable as an unwitting guide to the nuclear underworld.\n", "\n\"The Dutch wanted to arrest him,\" the diplomat said. \"But they were\ntold by the American CIA, 'Leave him so we can follow his trail.\"'\n", "\nA CHINESE CONNECTION\n", "\nKhan quickly led the agents to Beijing. It was there in the early\n1980s that Khan pulled off a coup: obtaining the blueprints for a\nweapon that China had detonated in its fourth nuclear test, in 1966.\nThe design was notable because it was compact and the first one China\nhad developed that could easily fit atop a missile.\n", "\nU.S. intelligence agencies only learned the full details of the\ntransactions earlier this year when the Libyans handed over two large\nplastic bags with the names of an Islamabad tailor on one side and a\ndry-cleaner on other -- one of several clues that it had come from\nthe Khan Laboratories. The design inside included drawings of more\nthan 100 parts, all fitting in a sphere about 34 inches in diameter,\njust the right size for a rocket.\n", "\nEqually remarkable were the handwritten notations in the margins.\n\"They made reference to Chinese ministers, presumably involved in the\ndeal,\" one official who reviewed it disclosed. And there was also a\nreference to \"Munir,\" apparently Munir Khan, Khan's rival who ran the\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission and was in a contest with Khan to\nput together a Pakistani weapon that would match India's.\n", "\nIn that race, size was critical, because only a small weapon could be\nput atop Pakistani missiles. One note in the margin of the design,\nthe official said, was that \"Munir's bomb would be bigger.\"\n", "\nIntelligence experts believe that Khan traded his centrifuge\ntechnology to the Chinese for their bomb design.\n", "\nA certain familiarity developed between Khan and those watching him.\n", "\n\"I remember I was once in Beijing on a nonproliferation mission,\"\nsaid Robert J. Einhorn, a longtime proliferation official in the\nState Department, \"and we knew that Khan was in Beijing, too, and\nwhere he was. I had this fantasy of going over to his hotel, calling\nup to his room, and inviting him down for a cup of coffee.\"\n", "\nOf course, he never did. But if he had, Khan might not have been\nsurprised.\n", "\nSimon Henderson, a London-based author who has written about Khan for\nmore than two decades, said the Pakistani scientist long suspected he\nwas under close surveillance. \"Khan once told me, indignantly, 'The\nBritish try to recruit members of my team as spies,\"' Henderson\nrecalled. \"As far as I'm aware, he was penetrated for a long, long\ntime.\"\n", "\nStill, for all the surveillance, U.S. officials always seemed a step\nor two behind. In the 1990s, noted Einhorn, the assumption was that\nIran was getting most of its help from Russia, which was providing\nthe country with reactors and laser-isotope technology. Virtually no\nattention was paid to its contacts with Khan.\n", "\n\"It was a classic case of being focused in the wrong place,\" Einhorn\nsaid. \"And if Iran gets the bomb in the next few years, it won't be\nbecause of the Russians. It will be because of the help they got from\nA.Q. Khan.\"\n", "\nTRIUMPH AND MYSTERY\n", "\nAs soon as Bush came to office, his director of central intelligence,\nGeorge J. Tenet, began tutoring him on the dangers of Khan and\ndisclosing how deeply the agency believed it had penetrated his life\nand network. \"We were inside his residence, inside his facilities,\ninside his rooms,\" Tenet said in a recent speech. \"We were everywhere\nthese people were.\"\n", "\nBut acting on the Khan problem meant navigating the sensitivities of\na fragile ally important in the effort against terrorism. That has\nimpeded the inquiry ever since.\n", "\nWashington had little leverage to force Pakistan's president, Gen.\nPervez Musharraf, to clamp down on a national hero, especially since\nKhan may have had evidence implicating the Pakistani government in\nsome of the transactions. And in interviews, officials said they\nfeared that moving on Khan too early would hurt their chances to roll\nup the network.\n", "\nStephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser, went to\nPakistan soon after the Sept. 11 attacks and raised concerns about\nKhan, some of whose scientists were said to have met with Osama bin\nLaden, al-Qaida's leader. But Hadley did not ask Musharraf to take\naction, according to a senior administration official. He returned to\nWashington complaining that it was unclear whether the Khan\nLaboratories were operating with the complicity of the Pakistani\nmilitary, or were controlled by freelancers, motivated by visions of\nprofit or of spreading the bomb to Islamic nations. The Pakistanis\ninsisted they had no evidence of any proliferation at all, a claim\nU.S. officials said they found laughable.\n", "\nAs evidence grew in 2003, Bush sent Tenet to New York to meet with\nMusharraf. \"We were afraid Khan's operation was entering a new, more\ndangerous phase,\" said one top official. Still there was little\naction.\n", "\nBut in late October 2003, the United States and its allies seized the\nBBC China, a freighter bearing centrifuge parts made in Malaysia,\nalong with other products of Khan's network, all bound for Libya.\nConfronted with the evidence, Libya finally agreed to surrender all\nof its nuclear program. Within weeks, tons of equipment was being\ndismantled and flown to the Energy Department's nuclear weapons lab\nat Oak Ridge, Tenn.\n", "\nPressures mounted on Musharraf. \"I said to him, 'We know so much\nabout this that we're going to go public with it,\"' Secretary of\nState Colin L. Powell told journalists last week. \"'And you need to\ndeal with this before you have to deal with it publicly.\"'\n", "\nOn television, Khan was forced to confess but he gave no specifics,\nand Musharraf pardoned the scientist. U.S. officials pressed to\ninterview him and his chief lieutenant, Tahir, a Sri Lankan\nbusinessman living in Dubai and Malaysia, who was eventually arrested\nby Malaysian authorities.\n", "\nBut the Pakistanis balked, insisting that they would pass questions\nto Khan and report back. Little information has been conveyed.\n", "\n\"Some questions simply were never answered,\" said one senior\nintelligence official. \"In other cases, you don't know if you were\ngetting Khan's answer, or the answer the government wanted you to\nhear.\"\n", "\nKhan's silence has extended to the question of what countries, other\nthan Libya, received the bomb design. Intelligence experts say they\nhave no evidence any other nation received the design, although they\nsuspect Iran and perhaps North Korea. But that search has been\nhampered by lack of hard intelligence.\n", "\n\"We strongly believe Iran did,\" said one U.S. official. \"But we need\nthe proof.\"\n", "\nKhan has also never discussed his ties with North Korea, a critical\nissue because the United States has alleged -- but cannot prove --\nthat North Korea has two nuclear arms programs, one using Khan\ntechnology.\n", "\n\"It is an unbelievable story, how this administration has given\nPakistan a pass on the single worst case of proliferation in the past\nhalf-century,\" said Jack Pritchard, who worked for President Clinton\nand served as the State Department's special envoy to North Korea\nuntil he quit last year, partly in protest over Bush's Korea policy.\n\"We've given them a pass because of Musharraf's agreement to fight\nterrorism, and now there is some suggestion that the hunt for Osama\nis waning. And what have we learned from Khan? Nothing.\"\n", "\nSOME MISSING PIECES\n", "\nIn March, U.S. investigators invited reporters to the giant nuclear\ncomplex in Oak Ridge to display the equipment disgorged by the\nLibyans. They surrounded the site with guards bearing automatic\nweapons, and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham joined the officials in\nshowing off some of the 4,000 centrifuges.\n", "\n\"We've had a huge success,\" he said.But it turned out that the\ncentrifuges were missing their rotors -- the high-speed internal\ndevice that makes them work. To this day, it is not clear where those\nparts were coming from. While some officials believe the Libyans were\ngoing to make their own, others fear the equipment had been shipped\nfrom an unknown location -- and that the network, while headless, is\nstill alive.\n", "\nJohn R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control and\ninternational security, echoed those suspicions, saying the network\nstill had a number of undisclosed customers. \"There's more out there\nthan we can discuss publicly,\" Bolton said in April.\n", "\nFederal and private experts said the list of suspected customers\nincludes Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Malaysia, Indonesia,\nAlgeria, Kuwait, Myanmar and Abu Dhabi.\n", "\nGiven the urgency of the Libyan and Khan disclosures, many private\nand governmental experts expected that the Bush administration and\nthe IAEA would work together. But European diplomats said the\nadministration never turned over valuable information to back up its\nwider suspicions about other countries. \"It doesn't like to share,\" a\nsenior European diplomat involved in nuclear intelligence said of the\nUnited States. \"That makes life more difficult. So we're on the\nlearning curve.\"\n", "\nFederal officials said they were reluctant to give the IAEA\nclassified information because the agency is too prone to leaks. The\nagency has 137 member states, and U.S. officials believe some of them\nmay be using the agency to hunt for nuclear secrets. One senior\nadministration official put it this way: \"The cops and the crooks all\nserve on the agency's board together.\"\n", "\nThe result is that two separate, disjointed searches are on for other\nnuclear rogue states -- one by Washington, the other by the IAEA. And\nthere is scant communication between the feuding bureaucracies.\n", "\nThat lack of communication with the U.N. agency extends to the\nNuclear Suppliers Group, a loose organization of countries that\nproduce nuclear equipment. It can stop the export of restricted\natomic technology to a suspect customer, but it does not report its\nactions to the IAEA. Moreover, there is no communication between the\nIAEA and the Bush administration's Proliferation Security Initiative,\nwhich seeks to intercept illicit nuclear trade at sea or in the air.\n", "\n\"It's a legitimate question whether we need a very different kind of\nsuper-agency that can deal with the new world of A.Q. Khans,\" said a\nsenior administration official. \"Because we sure don't have the\nsystem we need now.\"\n", "\nTHE HUNT GOES ON\n", "\nElBaradei, the head of the U.N. agency, says he is plunging ahead,\npursuing his own investigation even as the Bush administration\nattempts to have him replaced when his term expires late next year.\nIn an interview in Vienna, he defended his record, citing the\ninformation he has wrung out of Iran, and his agency's discovery of\ntendrils of Khan's network in more than 30 countries around the\nglobe.\n", "\n\"We're getting an idea of how it works,\" he said of the Khan network.\n\"And we're still looking\" for other suppliers and customers.\n", "\nOne method is to investigate the countries Khan visited before his\narrest. Nuclear experts disclosed that the countries were\nAfghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mali,\nMauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Saudi Arabia,\nSenegal, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. Many of\nthem are Islamic, and several of the African countries are rich in\nuranium ore.\n", "\nIn one of its biggest operations, the agency is hunting for nuclear\nclues in a half-dozen of the network's buildings and warehouses in\nDubai, which for years were used as the central location for\nassembling and repacking centrifuges.\n", "\nBoth in Washington and in Vienna, the most delicate investigations\ninvolve important American allies -- including Egypt and Saudi\nArabia. So far, said European intelligence officials familiar with\nthe agency's inner workings, no hard evidence of clandestine nuclear\narms programs has surfaced.\n", "\nSuspicious signs have emerged, however. For instance, experts\ndisclosed that SMB Computers, Tahir's front company in Dubai for the\nKhan network, made telephone calls to Saudi Arabia. But the company\nalso engaged in legitimate computer sales, giving it plausible cover.\nExperts also disclosed that Saudi scientists traveled to Pakistan for\nsome of Khan's scientific conferences. But the meetings were not\nsecret, or illegal.\n", "\nThere is also worry in both Washington and Vienna about Egypt, which\nhas two research reactors near Cairo and a long history of internal\ndebate about whether to pursue nuclear arms.

Bush praised the Red Sox for\ntheir hustling style of play and touted their organization for\nits long-standing charitable programs, including The Jimmy Fund.

The\ncity's new team, the Nationals, begins regular season play Monday,\nwith a home opener set for April 14, and it remains without a deal to\ntelevise its games. Whatever the local enthusiasm for the Nationals --\nand it appears to be enormous -- the absence of a television\nbroadcasting outlet is an impediment that will undercut early attempts\nto market the new team and give it a running start. This is\nunacceptable, and it is largely the doing of Mr. Angelos.\n", "\nMr. Angelos opposed bringing baseball to Washington on the grounds\nthat it might further damage his Orioles franchise, whose fortunes\nhave nose-dived in the 12 years since he purchased the team. In that\nhe may have a point; last week, the Orioles reported that ticket sales\nwere running 12 percent behind last year's level. He has insisted that\nMajor League Baseball should compensate him for the revenue he\nbelieves the Nationals will leech from the Orioles. According to\npublished reports, he has already received from baseball officials a\nguaranteed minimum price of $365 million should he decide to sell the\nOrioles. That's more than twice the amount Mr. Angelos paid for the\nfranchise in 1993 -- not bad for a team whose attendance has plummeted\non his watch.\n", "\nIf baseball officials want to indemnify Mr. Angelos for his\nanticipated financial losses, that's fine -- but not if the\ncompensation would come at the Nationals' expense. Yet with\nnegotiations in the eleventh hour, the Orioles' owner has insisted on\na prejudicial television broadcasting arrangement that would hold the\nNationals' financial fortunes hostage to his own whims indefinitely.\nClaiming a highly dubious exclusive right to broadcast all baseball in\nthis region, Mr. Angelos says Nationals games could be shown on his\nown Orioles regional network; in return for airing its games, he says\nhe would offer the Washington team a ``fair and appropriate fee'' --\nbut not an equity stake in the network or a percentage of broadcast\nprofits. In fact, such a deal is a rip-off that would deflate the\nNationals' value and imperil the task of finding a buyer for the\nfranchise -- an orphan that is now the collective property of\nbaseball's 29 team owners. What prospective Nationals' owner would\ncede control of broadcasting rights to a rival -- to say nothing of a\nrival as truculent as Mr. Angelos? Might as well trade away the team's\nbest sluggers and star pitchers.\n", "\nMr. Angelos has threatened to sue unless he gets his way. Evidently\nhoping to avoid the drawn-out, bare-knuckled litigation for which he\nis notorious, baseball officials have kept negotiations alive. But the\ntalks have gone on for six months, and time's up. The season starts\nnext week, and Washington's baseball-starved fans want to tune in.\nLawyers say Mr. Angelos's legal position is weak.

A further unusual property\nis that the genetic region has a much more ancient\nlineage than most human genes, and the researchers suggest, as\none possible explanation, that it could have entered the human\ngenome through interbreeding with one of the archaic human lineages\nthat developed in parallel with that of modern humans.\n", "\nThe genetic region was discovered by scientists at DeCode Genetics, a\nbiotechnology company in Reykjavik, Iceland, which has made the Icelandic\npopulation, with its comprehensive genealogy and medical records, a prime\nhunting ground for the genetic roots of common diseases. Their\nfinding is published in Monday's issue of Nature Genetics in\na report by Kari Stefansson, Augustine Kong, Hreinn Stefansson and\nother DeCode scientists.\n", "\nThe report seems likely to receive considerable attention, even though it\nraises as many questions as it answers. \"I thought it\nwas one of the most interesting papers in population genetics\nI have ever read,\" said Nick Patterson, a mathematician at\nthe Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who advised DeCode on\nthe article but has no other connection with the company.\n", "\nThe DNA region came to light during the search for a\nschizophrenia-causing gene, which turned out not to be there. But\nthe DeCode researchers noticed that the DNA sequences they had\nexamined did not seem to agree with those in the\nstandard human genome sequence, said Kari Stefansson, DeCode's chief executive.\n", "\nThe lack of agreement turned out to be caused by the\nfact that the region exists in two forms in the\nIcelandic population. The region is not a single gene but\na vast section of DNA, some 900,000 units in length,\nsituated in the 17th of the 23 pairs of human\nchromosomes. In some Icelanders, the DeCode team found, the section\nruns in the standard direction, but in others it is\nflipped. Looking for any physical consequence, the DeCode researchers found\nthat women carrying the inverted section tended to have slightly\nmore children.\n", "\nThe section carries several known genes, not one of which has\nany obvious connection with fertility. It is not clear why\ninverting the section should have any effect on the number\nof children, Stefansson said. But the inversion does increase the\nrate of recombination, the shuffling of genes between generations that\nis a major source of genetic novelty. That could account\nfor some of the increase in fertility.\n", "\nThe DeCode scientists found that the chromosome-17 inversion is rare in\nAfricans and almost absent in Asians, but is present in\n20 percent of Europeans, the same frequency as in Iceland.\nThe inversion seems to have been favored by natural selection\namong Europeans in fairly recent times, perhaps the past 10,000\nyears. \"Maybe something switched it on in the European environment,\nsuch as an interaction with diet,\" said David Reich, a\npopulation geneticist at the Broad Institute.\n", "\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n", "\nFertility is without doubt affected by different genes in different populations,\nand DeCode found a genetic element special to Europeans because\nthat is where it was looking. The increased frequency of\nthe inversion in Europeans is one of a growing number\nof examples of recent human evolution.\n", "\nThe inversion itself, however, is surprisingly ancient. Its age is revealed\nby its counterpart, the standard or noninverted section of chromosome\n17. The standard and inverted regions cannot exchange genetic elements\nduring recombination because their DNA sequences do not match. Hence,\nunlike most of the rest of the genome, which gets\nshuffled in each generation, the two forms have existed separately\nsince their creation. This event presumably happened when the region\ncame adrift from its parent chromosome and got knitted back\nin the opposite way.\n", "\nWhen all the known versions of a human gene are compared,\nin most cases they turn out to have had a\nsingle common ancestor about a million years ago. But the\nstandard and flipped versions of the chromosome 17 region last\nshared a common ancestor 3 million years ago. It is\nhighly unusual for two versions of a gene to endure\nfor so long, because one will usually get lost by\na natural process of elimination.\n", "\nThe DeCode researchers propose two explanations. One is that the standard\nand flipped versions confer different advantages, so that it is\nbeneficial for a person to have inherited a copy of\neach from different parents. This balancing selection can keep two\nversions of a gene around in a population indefinitely.\n", "\nDeCode's alternative proposal is that the flipped version was carried for\nmany years in a different human lineage, one of the\narchaic populations that preceded the emergence of anatomically modern humans\nin Africa 150,000 years ago. Then, in some episode of\ninterbreeding, a single copy of the flipped version entered the\nmodern human lineage some time before humans left Africa 60,000\nyears ago.\n", "\nIn support of this view, the flipped version carries far fewer\nmutations than does the standard version, as if it had\nbeen accumulating them from a much more recent date. There\nhave been other recent hints of modern human interaction with\narchaic hominids, notably the finding in October that a lineage\nof body lice seems to have been inherited from a\ndifferent human species.\n", "\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n", "\nStefansson said that another property of the inversion, though one not\ndescribed in Monday's article, was that it is associated with\nlongevity. DeCode scientists have located two sites on Icelanders' genomes\nwhere there is some genetic variant that promotes longer lifespan.\nThe chromosome 17 inversion, it turns out, lies at one\nof these sites. It occurs at much higher frequency in\nwomen over 95 and in men over 90 than in\nthe normal population. \"It seems to confer on people the\nability to live to extreme old age,\" Stefansson said.\n", "\nIt is particularly surprising that the same genetic element should promote\nfertility and longevity, because most organisms are obliged to follow\na strategy either of breeding fast during short lives or\nof living longer and having fewer children. \"Usually people think\nof there being a tradeoff between fertility and longevity.

Rutan\nwon the $10 million Ansari X Prize for the advancement\nof space tourism.\n", "\nThe Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer -- first sketched by Rutan on\nthe back of a napkin in 1999 -- is undoubtedly\none of the strangest-looking flying machines ever to take wing\nover the Kansas heartland.\n", "\nBuilt by Rutan's Scaled Composites of Mojave, Calif., it consists of\ntwo 44-foot lightweight carbon fiber torpedoes joined at the hip.\nA cigar-shaped cockpit is suspended between, with a single jet\nengine -- a modified turbofan like those used in corporate\njets -- mounted above and behind the cockpit.

Commercial airliners carry less than\nhalf their weight in fuel.\n", "\nAt takeoff, because so much fuel is stored in the plane's\nhollow wings, they will droop to within 3 feet of\nthe runway -- meaning any sudden gust of wind could\nbecome an adventure-ending disaster.\n", "\n\"It's an experimental aircraft with such lightweight construction there's a risk\nof structural failure,\" Fossett says. \"The first time it flies\nwith a full load of fuel will be when I\ntake off on the mission.

Most of that is a result of rising costs, primarily\nnatural gas.\n", "\n\"On the renewable front, it does bode well that customers can choose\nmore environmentally friendly power for the price most residential\ncustomers pay,\" Morstad said. \"But this is also a signal that the\nprice to beat has gotten very high.\"\n", "\nThe cost of renewable energy hasn't necessarily dropped, either.\nWhile the cost of wind power is supposed to stay relatively stable\ncompared with power generated by coal and natural gas, Green Mountain\nrecently increased the price of its 100 percent wind product. Because\nthe company must buy some power on the open market to meet customer\nneeds, it is also subject to the fuel price increases imposed by its\nsuppliers, Savage said.\n", "\nReliant Energy does not offer a renewable energy plan in the Houston\narea -- state electricity deregulation laws allow it to offer only\none plan here until Jan. 1, 2005 -- but it has offered a plan to\nDallas-area customers for several years.\n", "\nJim Robb, Reliant's senior vice president of retail marketing, said\nthe renewable plan has been priced to roughly match the cost of the\nDallas area's incumbent provider, TXU. The power comes from a\ncombination of wind and landfill-produced natural gas.\n", "\n\"We haven't seen major evidence of increased interest in a renewable\nproduct,\" Robb said, noting that about 1,400 customers have signed on\nto its plan. \"We could offer such a plan in Houston next year if we\nfind customer demand, but we haven't gone to the expense of marketing\nthe plan.\"\n", "\nThere are no other renewable energy plans offered in the Houston\narea.

the International Bar Association Conference on the worldwide application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights today (Saturday):\n", "\nLadies and gentlemen,\n", "\nI am honoured to be invited to speak at this important conference on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n", "\nFor those of you who are visiting Hong Kong, may I extend a warm welcome and wish you an enjoyable and rewarding stay here.\n", "\nHong Kong is, I believe, an appropriate location for this conference.\n", "\nNot only does it have a great deal to offer visitors, but also, so far as the ICCPR is concerned, it has set an example for other jurisdictions.\n", "\nThe ICCPR\n", "\nThe ICCPR has applied to Hong Kong, at the international level, since the year it came into force - 1976 - and it continues to apply to the Hong Kong SAR.\n", "\nSince 1991, relevant provisions of the ICCPR, as applied to Hong Kong, have been incorporated into Hong Kong's domestic law by virtue of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.\n", "\nThat Ordinance is now one of the laws of the Hong Kong SAR.\n", "\nSince reunification, the ICCPR has been given a special status in Hong Kong by virtue of Article 39 of the Basic Law, which is Hong Kong's new mini-constitution.\n", "\nThe first paragraph of Article 39 provides that the provisions of the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and shall be implemented through the laws of the Special Administrative Region.\n", "\nThe second paragraph provides that the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents shall not be restricted unless as prescribed by law, and that such restrictions shall not contravene the provisions of the preceding paragraph.\n", "\nThe ICCPR is therefore firmly rooted in Hong Kong's legal system.\n", "\nOn December 4, 1997, China's Permanent Representative to the UN issued a diplomatic note to the UN Secretary General informing him that, in line with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and considering that China is not yet a signatory to the ICCPR, China will make reference to the provisions under the ICCPR and transmit reports on the HKSAR to the UN through China's Permanent Representative to the UN.\n", "\nThe reports will be drafted by the SAR Government and submitted to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for onward transmission to the United Nations Human Rights Committee.\n", "\nWe plan to submit the first report in August this year.\n", "\nAnother welcome development occurred in March this year, when China announced that it would sign the ICCPR.\n", "\nThis is particularly significant for Hong Kong, since China's accession to the ICCPR will reinforce Hong Kong's human rights regime.\n", "\nThe resumption of sovereignty\n", "\nAs I am sure you all know, at the end of this month the Hong Kong SAR will celebrate its first anniversary.\n", "\nI would therefore like to take this opportunity to review the effect of the reunification, and to discuss some of the significant legal developments that have occurred in the past 12 months.\n", "\nSome of these developments have been the subject of criticism, but I firmly believe that, when properly understood in the context of the resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, they were fully justified.\n", "\nMoreover, they were consistent with the SAR's obligations under the ICCPR.\n", "\nSo far as the legal system and human rights are concerned, the resumption of sovereignty has been highly successful.\n", "\nUnder the principle of 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has retained its own separate legal system, together with the rule of law and an independent judiciary.\n", "\nThe common law and almost all the statutory laws previously in force have been adopted as laws of the SAR.\n", "\nAll judges serving immediately before reunification were re-appointed on the recommendation of the independent Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission.\n", "\nAnd the new Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, which replaces the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, makes our highest appellate court more accessible to litigants.\n", "\nIn addition, the local and overseas judges who have been appointed to that court are of the highest calibre, and have already given the court a reputation for quality, integrity and independence.\n", "\nA further aspect of the new order that is significant is that, under Article 63 of the Basic Law, the Department of Justice of the SAR controls prosecutions, free from interference.\n", "\nThat department, which I head, is continuing to apply well-established and politically neutral criteria in respect of decisions to prosecute.\n", "\nI wish to re-affirm that the political persuasion or personal connections of any suspected offender have not been, and will not be, factors in prosecution decision-making in the SAR.\n", "\nThe Bill of Rights Ordinance\n", "\nAs I said a moment ago, almost all the statutory laws previously in force have been adopted as laws of the SAR.\n", "\nThe basis for that position is Article 160 of the Basic Law.\n", "\nThis provides that, upon the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall be adopted as laws of the Region 'except for those which the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress declares to be in contravention of [the Basic Law].'\n", "\nIn February 1997, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress resolved that 24 Ordinances, in whole or in part, contravened the Basic Law and were not to be adopted as laws of the SAR.\n", "\nAmongst the provisions that were not adopted were three provisions in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.\n", "\nI hasten to add, however, that the non-adoption of these provisions did not dilute the rights and freedoms enshrined in that Ordinance.\n", "\nThe provisions in question stated -\n", "\n* firstly, that in interpreting and applying the Ordinance, regard should be had to the fact that its purpose is to provide for the incorporation into the law of Hong Kong of provisions of the ICCPR;\n", "\n* secondly, that all pre-existing legislation that admits of a construction consistent with the Ordinance shall be given such a construction, and legislation that does not admit of such a constructions is, to the extent of the inconsistency, repealed; and\n", "\n* thirdly, that legislation enacted on and after the commencement of the Bill of Rights Ordinance shall, to the extent that it admits of such a construction, be construed as to be consistent with the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong.\n", "\nAs I said earlier, the continued application of the ICCPR is guaranteed by Article 39 of the Basic Law.\n", "\nThe non-adoption of the three provisions in the Bill of Rights Ordinance has not therefore diluted the rights and freedoms enshrined in the ICCPR, or the protection of those rights and freedoms in Hong Kong's domestic law.\n", "\nLater on I will mention a number of cases in which the Bill of Rights has been relied upon in court challenges since Reunification.\n", "\nThe Provisional Legislative Council\n", "\nLet me now turn to one of the most controversial aspects of the reunification, which was the establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council.\n", "\nThe political background to this development is well-known, but let me summarise the legal aspects of it.\n", "\nArticle 68 of the Basic Law provides that the Legislative Council shall be constituted by election.\n", "\nAnnex II of the Basic Law states that, in the first term, the Legislative Council shall be formed in accordance with a specified decision of the National People's Congress.\n", "\nThat decision was made on April 4, 1990, the same day as the Basic Law was promulgated.\n", "\nThe decision provided for a Preparatory Committee to be established in 1996, one task of which was to prescribe the specific method for forming the first Legislative Council of the SAR.\n", "\nThe decision also set out the composition of the first Legislative Council, namely 20 members to be returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, 10 members by an election committee, and 30 members by functional constituencies.\n", "\nThat, in fact, is the composition of the first SAR LegCo that was elected last month.\n", "\nWhere, you may ask, does that leave the Provisional Legislative Council?\n", "\nThe answer is as follows.\n", "\nAt the time of the promulgation of the Basic Law in April 1990, it was hoped that there would be a 'through train' for members of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council.\n", "\nHowever, as a result of the political reforms instituted by the last Governor, this became impossible.\n", "\nThe composition of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council was not acceptable to the People's Republic of China.\n", "\nAs a result, in August 1994 the Standing Committee of the NPC authorised the Preparatory Committee to organise the first SAR Legislative Council in accordance with the 1990 decision of the NPC.\n", "\nIn March 1996 the Preparatory Committee decided to set up the Provisional Legislative Council.\n", "\nThe composition of that Council did not conform with the composition of the first SAR Legislative Council set out in the NPC's decision of 1990.\n", "\nIn particular, it was not formed by the kind of elections required by that decision.\n", "\nBut the Provisional Legislative Council never purported to be the first SAR Legislative Council.\n", "\nIt was an interim body set up, out of necessity, with limited terms of reference to assist the first SAR Government in the absence of the first Legislative Council.\n", "\nGiven the breakdown in the 'through train', it was simply not possible to establish the first SAR Legislative Council without some form of interim legislature.\n", "\nIn the absence of such a legislature, it would not have been possible to enact the electoral laws needed to establish the first SAR Legislative Council.\n", "\nMoreover, other essential legislation could not have been passed, and government funding could not have been approved, at a critical time for the SAR.\n", "\nThe Provisional Legislative Council was therefore needed as a matter of political necessity.\n", "\nThere were those who argued that the Council was not legally constituted, since it was not provided for in the Basic Law.\n", "\nThose arguments were put before the SAR's Court of Appeal in a landmark case in July of last year.\n", "\nThe court unanimously held that the Provisional Legislative Council was lawfully established by the Preparatory Committee, exercising the authority and powers conferred on it by the National People's Congress.\n", "\nSo far as the ICCPR is concerned, I would point out that when the United Kingdom ratified the covenant in 1976 it did so subject to certain reservations.\n", "\nOne of these was in respect of Article 25, which provides for periodic elections to be conducted by universal and equal suffrage.\n", "\nThe reservation was to the effect that the Article did not require the establishment of an elected Executive or Legislative Council in Hong Kong.\n", "\nThat reservation still applies to the Hong Kong SAR and is reflected in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.\n", "\nNeither the Provisional Legislative Council, nor the first SAR Legislative Council, are therefore inconsistent with international obligations or domestic law applying in Hong Kong.\n", "\nIn my view, the Provisional Legislative Council served the Hong Kong SAR well.\n", "\nHad there been no such interim legislature the results would have been potentially disastrous.\n", "\nThe Council put in place essential legislation and ensured that necessary funding for the SAR Government was available.\n", "\nSome of the laws enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council were controversial.\n", "\nI propose to review those controversial laws and explain how they are fully justified.\n", "\nIt is essential to bear in mind not only that the ICCPR applies to the SAR, but also that the SAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, and must comply with the Basic Law.\n", "\nCertain amendments to our laws were a necessary part of the establishment of the SAR in accordance with the Basic Law.\n", "\nSocieties Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance\n", "\nLet me start with the amendments to the Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance enacted on July 1, 1997.\n", "\nBoth Ordinances have played a key role in maintaining law and order in Hong Kong.\n", "\nHowever, a few years before Reunification, major amendments were made to them.\n", "\nUnder the Societies Ordinance as originally enacted, societies generally had to be registered.\n", "\nIn 1992 the Ordinance was amended in two important ways.\n", "\nFirst, there was a repeal of the provision permitting the Registrar to refuse to register a society if it was connected with any political group established outside Hong Kong; and secondly, the registration system was replaced by a notification system.\n", "\nThe Public Order Ordinance contains provisions dealing with public meetings and processions.\n", "\nIn 1995, the Ordinance was amended, in particular, by replacing the licensing system that applied to public processions by a system of prior notification.\n", "\nIn February 1997, the Standing Committee of the NPC resolved that the major amendments to the Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance made in 1992 and 1995 respectively would not be adopted as the laws of the SAR.\n", "\nIf no action had been taken, there would have been a legal vacuum after reunification, since there would have been no law governing the formation of societies or the regulation of public demonstrations and processions.\n", "\nIn order to avoid this, the Chief Executive of the SAR issued a consultation document in April 1997 in respect of proposals to amend the two Ordinances.\n", "\nAfter taking into account public views received, the Chief Executive's Office prepared two Bills.\n", "\nThese were passed by the Provisional Legislative Council and came into effect on July 1, 1997.\n", "\nIn preparing these Bills, care was taken to ensure that restrictions imposed on freedom of association and freedom of assembly were consistent with the ICCPR.\n", "\nIn the case of the Societies Ordinance, new societies are now required to apply for registration, or exemption from registration, within one month of establishment.\n", "\nAn application may be refused if the Societies Officer reasonably believes that the refusal is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, public order (ordre public) or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\n", "\nThe Ordinance expressly states that the last three of these expressions are to be interpreted in the same way as under the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong.\n", "\nAn application may also be refused if the society is a political body that has a connection with a foreign political organisation or a political organisation of Taiwan.\n", "\nThis is consistent with Article 23 of the Basic Law, which requires the SAR to enact laws to prohibit political organisations or bodies in the SAR from establishing ties with foreign political organisations or bodies.\n", "\nIn the case of the Public Order Ordinance, organisers of public meetings and processions are required to notify the Commissioner of Police of their intention to hold the meeting or procession.\n", "\nIn the case of a proposed public procession, if the Commissioner of Police does not object to it, he must issue a 'notice of no objection'.\n", "\nThe Commissioner of Police may only prohibit a public procession or meeting if he reasonably considers that this is 'necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public) or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.' Again, the last three of those expressions are to be interpreted in the same way as under the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong.\n", "\nThe amendments to the Public Order Ordinance and Societies Ordinance were subject to some criticism at the time they were made.\n", "\nSome feared that they indicated an approach that was hostile to human rights.\n", "\nThat fear was misplaced.\n", "\nThe amendments struck the right balance between civil liberties and social order.\n", "\nThey reflected both the ICCPR and the Basic Law and, as I am sure you can see for yourselves, political activities and demonstrations in Hong Kong remain as lively as ever.\n", "\nLet me illustrate that statement by some revealing statistics.\n", "\nFrom July 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998, there have been over 1,260 public demonstrations in Hong Kong and 626 societies formed.\n", "\nOn average, about 140 demonstrations have been held each month since the handover, compared with 87 demonstrations a month before the handover in 1997.\n", "\nThe police have not objected to the holding of any of these demonstrations nor refused any application for formation of societies.\n", "\nLegislative Provisions (Suspension of Operation) Ordinance 1997\n", "\nLet me now turn to another legislative problem that had to be faced after Reunification.\n", "\nAt the last sitting of the former Legislative Council in June 1997, a number of Private Members Bills were hastily passed without detailed scrutiny by a Bills Committee and without full consultation with those affected.\n", "\nConsiderable public concern was expressed about this legislation.\n", "\nThe SAR Government adopted a rational approach of promoting legislation to suspend the operation of four of those enactments, until their impact could be thoroughly analysed and proper consultation carried out.\n", "\nThree of the enactments related to employment law.\n", "\nThe Administration reviewed those enactments in close consultation with the Labour Advisory Board - a well-established tripartite consultative forum comprising the Government, employers and employees.\n", "\nAt the end of the review, the Administration promoted legislation that was eventually passed by the Provisional Legislative Council.\n", "\nThe effect of that legislation was to repeal two of the employment Ordinances and amend the third.\n", "\nThe other Ordinance whose operation was suspended was the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (Amendment) Ordinance 1997.\n", "\nI am sure that this will be of particular interest to delegates at this Conference.\n", "\nThe background to that Ordinance was as follows.\n", "\nWhen the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance was enacted in 1991, it included a provision to the effect that it was binding only on the Government and public authorities, and on any person acting on behalf of the Government or a public authority.\n", "\nThe 1997 amendment, which was not scrutinised by any Bills Committee, added a provision stating that the Ordinance applied (and I quote) 'to all legislation, whether that legislation affects legal relations between the Government, public authorities and private persons, or whether it affects only relations between private persons.'\n", "\nThe operation of this amendment was suspended, pending a review of its implications.\n", "\nEventually, the Administration decided that the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance should be restored to its original form, and a Bill to repeal the amendment was enacted.\n", "\nThere were several objections to the amendment.\n", "\nIts drafting and interaction with other parts of the Ordinance caused uncertainty and confusion.\n", "\nMore importantly, it could have greatly complicated litigation between private persons by bringing into question the validity of legislation affecting them.\n", "\nIt should be noted that although the ICCPR requires action to be taken in respect of certain types of activity, such as discrimination, by private citizens, this can and is being dealt with by specific legislation.\n", "\nAnd Article 39 of the Basic Law, which I mentioned earlier, guarantees that Hong Kong residents will enjoy the standards of human rights prescribed in the ICCPR.\n", "\nThe amendment Ordinance was therefore more trouble than it was worth, and its repeal was not inconsistent with the Administration's commitment to protect human rights in Hong Kong.\n", "\nImmigration Ordinance\n", "\nLet me now turn to amendments to the Immigration Ordinance enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council.\n", "\nIt is, I think, self-evident that Hong Kong has to control the flow of immigrants from the Mainland.\n", "\nSince 1982 this has been achieved through a One-Way Exit Permit System, which involves a daily quota of permits being issued by Mainland authorities.\n", "\nThis system has worked well.\n", "\nThe Reunification introduced a new factor in respect of immigration, since Article 24 of the Basic Law confers a right of abode in the SAR on a number of categories of people.\n", "\nThese include persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of Chinese citizens who were either born in Hong Kong or who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years.\n", "\nThe effect of that article is to confer a right of abode in the SAR on tens of thousands of children born and raised in the Mainland, who did not previously have such a right.\n", "\nIf all these children arrived at once, the impact on the social support services would be extremely difficult to bear.\n", "\nMoreover, it would be undesirable to allow all children who claim to have the right of abode in Hong Kong to enter Hong Kong before their status can be determined.\n", "\nThe Administration therefore introduced amendments to the Immigration Ordinance to implement a Certificate of Entitlement Scheme in respect of such Mainland children.\n", "\nIn order to enjoy their right of abode, they must hold a valid travel document, which in practice means a valid one-way exit permit issued by Mainland authorities, to which there is affixed a valid certificate of entitlement issued by the Department of Immigration.\n", "\nIn order to obtain such a certificate, they must prove to the satisfaction of the Director that at least one of their parents had the right of abode in Hong Kong.\n", "\nThe scheme has been controversial - as immigration controls often are.\n", "\nI will deal later with the legal challenges that have been made to the legislation.\n", "\nFor now, I would point out that other common law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, have similar methods of verifying a person's immigration status; and that Hong Kong's new scheme has been running smoothly.\n", "\nIn the first nine months following Reunification, it has ensured a speedy and orderly admission of nearly 17,000 Mainland children.\n", "\nLegislative Council Ordinance\n", "\nI mentioned earlier that one of the essential tasks of the Provisional Legislative Council was to enact the electoral law that would make it possible for the first Legislative Council of the SAR to be established in accordance with the Basic Law.\n", "\nThat law, the Legislative Council Ordinance, was enacted in September last year, and regulated the election of Legislative Councillors that took place last month.\n", "\nThat election involved a record number of registered voters (2.8 million), a record number of candidates (166), and a record participation of 53 per cent of registered voters.\n", "\nIn accordance with the Basic Law, the first Legislative Council consists of 60 members, elected directly or indirectly.\n", "\nTwenty members were elected by universal suffrage from geographical constituencies, on the basis of a proportional representation voting system.\n", "\nThirty members were indirectly elected from functional constituencies.\n", "\nThese constituencies represent economic and professional sectors, such as the labour, real estate and medical sectors, that are substantial and of importance to the community.\n", "\nThe final 10 members were indirectly elected by an Election Committee consisting of 800 members.\n", "\nThe great majority of those members were returned through elections supervised by an independent Electoral Affairs Commission.\n", "\nThese arrangements are in accordance with the Basic Law, which contains a blueprint for Hong Kong's democratic development.\n", "\nProgress in this respect will be gradual and orderly.\n", "\nFor example, the proportion of members of the Legislative Council to be elected by universal suffrage will be increased to half for the Council's third term.\n", "\nFurther progress in this direction after the year 2007 can be decided upon by the community, in accordance with the Basic Law.\n", "\nAdaptation of Laws (Interpretative Provisions) Ordinance 1998\n", "\nThe final piece of legislation I will mention is an adaptation of laws Ordinance.\n", "\nFollowing Reunification, the laws of Hong Kong need to be textually amended to remove colonial terminology that is no longer appropriate.\n", "\nFor example, references to the 'Governor' need to be replaced by references to the 'Chief Executive'.\n", "\nOne such amendment was recently made to a provision relating to the 'Crown'.\n", "\nThe provision stated that the Crown was not bound by any Ordinance unless the Ordinance contained an express provision, or a necessary implication, to the contrary.\n", "\nThis reflected a common law principle that applies in almost all common law jurisdictions.\n", "\nIn adapting that reference to the 'Crown', great care was taken to ensure that the new provision accurately reflected the meaning of that expression.\n", "\nIn this context, the 'Crown' included Her Majesty the Queen, the British Government, British Forces in Hong Kong, and the former Hong Kong Government.\n", "\nThe word 'Crown' was replaced by the word 'State', which was defined so as to encompass corresponding organs of the PRC.\n", "\nThese are the President of the PRC, the Central People's Government (CPG), central authorities which exercise functions for which the CPG is responsible under the Basic Law, the Government of HKSAR, and certain subordinate organs of the CPG or those central authorities.\n", "\nA subordinate organ of the CPG or of those central authorities is within the definition of 'State' only if it satisfies the following three tests:\n", "\n* it carries out executive functions of the CPG or functions for which the CPG has responsibility under the Basic Law;\n", "\n* it does not exercise commercial functions; and\n", "\n* it is acting within the scope of the functions and authority delegated to it by the CPG or the relevant central authority.\n", "\nThe adaptation of this provision therefore does no more, and no less, than preserve the substance of the law before Reunification and reflect the change in sovereignty.\n", "\nIt has, however, given rise to the most startling misconceptions.\n", "\nSome overseas press reports stated that Chinese State-owned Enterprises have been given a special status in Hong Kong.\n", "\nThis is quite wrong.\n", "\nThe definition of 'State' expressly excludes any organs that exercise commercial functions.\n", "\nAnd assertions that relevant State organs are 'above the law' are equally misleading.\n", "\nNo one ever asserted that the British Government, the British Forces in Hong Kong, or the former Hong Kong Government were above the law - because they were not.\n", "\nThe same position holds true of the SAR Government and relevant State organs.\n", "\nI would add that Hong Kong's autonomy to enact laws that are binding on State organs is completely unaffected by this amendment.\n", "\nCourt challenges under the Basic Law\n", "\nHaving reviewed various Ordinances enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council, let me now turn to the court challenges that have been made to some of those Ordinances.\n", "\nThese challenges have been possible after Reunification because, for the first time, Hong Kong now has a detailed written constitution.\n", "\nLitigants are therefore able to challenge legislation on the basis that it is inconsistent with the provisions in the Basic Law.\n", "\nThose provisions include Article 39, which provides for the continued implementation of the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong.\n", "\nI have already mentioned the case in which the legality of the Provisional Legislative Council was unsuccessfully challenged.\n", "\nThat case also involved an assertion that the common law had not survived Reunification, since it had not been positively adopted as part of the laws of the SAR.\n", "\nArticle 160 of the Basic Law provides that, upon the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong 'shall be adopted as laws of the Region'.\n", "\nThe court unanimously held that this article did not require any formal adoption of the laws previously in force and so the common law did survive Reunification.\n", "\nThere have also been challenges to the immigration legislation which introduced the certificate of entitlement scheme, and which implemented other relevant provisions of the Basic Law.\n", "\nThose cases have now been heard by the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal and may yet be appealed to the Court of Final Appeal and so my following comments are subject to the outcome of any such appeal.\n", "\nThe scheme itself was attacked on four main grounds.\n", "\nFirst, it was argued that a person who claims the right of abode in Hong Kong by descent is entitled under the Basic Law to entry into Hong Kong before he or she establishes the facts giving rise to the claim.\n", "\nIt was therefore claimed that those persons could not be required to produce a certificate of entitlement before being allowed entry.\n", "\nSecondly, it was argued that it was not permissible to use immigration legislation as a means of avoiding the social problems that would arise if large numbers of Mainland children exercised their right of abode at the same time.\n", "\nThirdly, it was argued that the scheme was incompatible with Article 8(4) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, since it arbitrarily deprived persons of the right of abode in Hong Kong.\n", "\nFourthly, it was argued that the scheme could not lawfully be made retrospective to 1 July 1997.\n", "\nThe first three arguments were rejected by the court.\n", "\nThe Basic Law merely identifies the categories of persons who have the right of abode in Hong Kong, and leaves the question as to how the facts on which the claim to right of abode should be established to be determined by the legislature.\n", "\nMoreover, the Basic Law itself requires persons living in Mainland China who seek to exercise their right of abode in Hong Kong to obtain a one-way exit permit from the Chinese authorities before coming to Hong Kong.\n", "\nThe fact that those claiming the right of abode by descent were singled out for the certificate of entitlement scheme did not deprive them of their right to enter Hong Kong, nor was it an arbitrary scheme.\n", "\nWith regard to provision making the legislative scheme retrospective to July 1, 1997, the court upheld the provision.\n", "\nIt held that the restrictions on the exercise of the right of abode were already contained in the Basic Law, which was in place on July 1, 1997.\n", "\nIt nevertheless held that the scheme did not apply to persons in Hong Kong who arrived before that date even though their presence in Hong Kong before that date was unlawful.\n", "\nTwo particular aspects of the legislation have also been challenged.\n", "\nA provision requiring children born out of wedlock to derive their right of abode through their mothers and not through their fathers was declared to contravene the Basic Law and was excised from the legislation.\n", "\nSuch children were considered to be within the categories of children who are given the right of abode.\n", "\nAnother provision restricting the right of abode of children born outside Hong Kong to those whose mother or father had acquired the right of abode in Hong Kong by the date of their birth was at first held to contravene the Basic Law.\n", "\nHowever, on appeal it was held that this provision reflected the plain meaning of the words of the Basic Law.\n", "\nThere is one further area, namely regulation of the civil service, which has been the subject of a challenge under the Basic Law.\n", "\nBefore Reunification, the regulation of the civil service was achieved by means of Colonial Regulations, issued by the Secretary of State to the Governor, and regulations made under them by the Governor.\n", "\nAfter Reunification, the Chief Executive issued an Executive Order in respect of the Civil Service, under Article 48(4) of the Basic Law, and issued regulations under that Order.\n", "\nThese instruments were challenged by the Association of Expatriate Civil Servants.\n", "\nThe Basic Law requires that the previous system in respect of public servants 'shall be maintained', and that the appointment and removal of public officers shall be 'in accordance with legal procedures'.\n", "\nIt was argued that these requirements had not been satisfied, as the new scheme had not been approved by the Legislative Council.\n", "\nThe court rejected the challenge, holding that the previous system was established by executive action and could therefore be maintained in a similar manner.\n", "\nThe court did, however, declare that public officers were not bound by one provision which prohibited a public officer under interdiction from leaving Hong Kong without permission.\n", "\nIt was held that this was a restriction on the freedom to leave Hong Kong, protected by Article 8(2) of the Bill of Rights, and the restriction was not 'provided by law'.\n", "\nThe court therefore declared that holders of public office to whom the Executive Order applies were not bound by that restriction.\n", "\nHuman Rights and the Rule of Law\n", "\nWhat do these court challenges and decisions demonstrate?\n", "\nIn my view, they demonstrate that human rights are fully protected in the SAR by an independent Judiciary, and that the rule of law is as strong as ever.\n", "\nMembers of the community are able to challenge laws and procedures that they consider to be inconsistent with the ICCPR, or the Basic Law, and in some cases those challenges have been successful.\n", "\nThey also demonstrate that the Provisional Legislative Council was lawfully established and that the immigration legislation enacted by it was, with the exception of one provision, lawfully enacted.\n", "\nChallenges ahead\n", "\nWhat of the future?\n", "\nThere are many significant legal challenges ahead.\n", "\nAs many of you may know, Article 23 of the Basic Law provides that the Hong Kong SAR shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, or subversion against the Central People's Government.\n", "\nThis provision is a reflection of Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy since, even though the offences referred to are offences against the Central People's Government, the SAR is to enact its own legislation in respect of them.\n", "\nIn preparing this legislation, the SAR Government will have full regard to the provisions in the ICCPR and the Basic Law concerning freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.\n", "\nIt will also take into account public opinion.\n", "\nThe proposals will be fully debated by the members of the Legislative Council and will need to be acceptable to them.\n", "\nAnother challenge lying ahead is the development of a bilingual legal system in Hong Kong.\n", "\nThe foundations for this have already been laid, in that all our Ordinances are bilingual, and all courts are allowed to operate in either the English or Chinese language.\n", "\nA large proportion of cases heard in the magistracies are already conducted in Cantonese.\n", "\nIn developing bilingualism, we are determined that the quality of the administration of justice should be maintained.\n", "\nWe will continue to develop a body of jurisprudence in respect of the Basic Law.\n"]}, "Group_661": {"19981012_016.e": ["\nEC's working groups discuss future education goals\n", "\nThe following is issued on behalf of the Education Commission:\n", "\nThe

and to touch off a territory-wide discussion to identify a consensual orientation for education development.\n", "\nMr Leung said: \"The consultation, conducted from January 22 to March 6 this year, was extensive.\n", "\nA total of 160,000 copies of a consultation document and 1.5 million copies of a pamphlet were distributed to the public.\n", "\nEC representatives attended over 55 consultation

making up 56 per cent and 27 per cent of the total respectively.\n", "\n\"Next are the teachers who make up 10 per cent of the respondents.\n", "\nThe rest is from tertiary institutions, schools, professionals, social workers, and various education and business organisations.\n", "\n\"It can be discerned from the public views that in general, the community want educational reform.\n", "\nThe present system is considered too examination-oriented, with too much emphasis on rote-learning.\n", "\nIt can no longer meet the needs of Hong Kong.\n", "\nThe public also generally agree with the aims of education as stated, although some want the aims to be more specific and measurable, rather than broad and idealistic.\n", "\n\"The public have raised several concerns.\n", "\nMany parents and students say that too much homework are making the students lose interest in learning.\n", "\nThey also want the quality of teaching to be improved.\n", "\nA large number of respondents call for the curriculum of primary and secondary education to be reduced, with more emphasis on developing creative thinking and analytical power.\n", "\nThe poor communication skills of many school leavers is another problem highlighted.\n", "\nThe need for moral and civic education to be strengthened is also frequently brought up.\"\n", "\nMr Leung said that some observations could be made based on the views received and the concerns expressed.\n", "\n\"First of all, \" he said, \"the public clearly support a 'student-centred' approach to implementing the aims of education, with emphasis on four key areas: students should enjoy and love learning, be capable of self-learning; be able to communicate effectively in both Chinese and English; be creative and able to think independently and critically; be willing to take responsibility for themselves and have commitment to their families, society, nation, and the world at large.\n", "\n\"In order to succeed in the four key areas, the support and involvement of the schools and teachers is very important.\n", "\nConsideration should be made to reducing constraints on schools and teachers.\n", "\nThis can be achieved through relieving teachers from performing too many administrative duties, as well as allowing more flexibility and autonomy to schools under the school-based management framework.\n", "\n\"The consultation has also raised awareness among the public that everyone has a role to play in promoting quality education.\n", "\nIn particular, the teachers' role is considered to be critical.\n", "\nThe public want the teachers to be given more support and recognition, while measures should be taken to raise their standards and calibre.\n", "\nThe public also feel that the parents should understand the meaning of quality education and work closely with schools to make sure that their children are receiving it.\n", "\nThe community at large must be involved by providing support to schools and teachers in the spirit of co-operation and partnership.\n", "\nThe media must accept that it has a social responsibility in providing a positive influence on the moral and civic attitudes of students.\n", "\n\"We understand that educational reform must not be driven from the top.\n", "\nIt must be a collective effort, with the co-operation of all concerned parties.\n", "\nFurthermore, in order to ensure that the reform is successful, we must not add to the workload of those involved, but must reduce their constraints.\n", "\nThe EC will keep these two points in mind in the subsequent stages of the review,\" said Mr Leung.\n", "\nLooking ahead to the next stage of the review, Mr Leung said that the EC would refine the overall aims of education as well as aims for the individual learning stages based on the views received.\n", "\nHe added: \"The aims will provide the basis for the EC to set the education reform agenda for the next stage of the review, which will involve a review of the curriculum, assessment process and academic structure.\n", "\n\"The EC will also look at other areas of education, such as informal and non-formal education, vocational education and continuing education, and their interface with formal education.\n", "\n\"We also appreciate the importance of moral and civic education.\n", "\nArising from the recent incidents involving youth gangs, many people in the community are concerned about the moral behaviour of our students.\n", "\nWe will take this into account in our next stage of the review.\n", "\n\"The EC will work together with other education-related bodies

on the premises and they should be able to meet the licensing requirements within this financial year.\n", "\n(b) In April 1999, the occupancy rate was over 96% for subvented RCHEs and 95% for care places purchased from private RCHEs.\n", "\nThe average waiting time for admission to subvented RCHE was 29 months and, about 9 months for care places purchased from private RCHEs.\n", "\n(c) At present, when applying for admission to RCHEs, an elderly person can express their personal preferences, including applying for a care place in a subvented home or a private RCHE participating in the bought place scheme, the location of the RCHE, the religious background of the operating agency and the diet provided.\n", "\nWaiting time varies significantly depending on the elderly's choices.\n", "\nWith more subsidised care places coming on-stream in the past six months, the average waiting time has shortened significantly.\n", "\nHowever, due to their choices, some elderly persons who have been on the waiting list for some time have yet to be admitted.\n", "\nWe consider the existing application system too complicated.\n", "\nSome elderly people might not be aware of the implications on the waiting time when making their choices for residential homes.\n", "\nIn view of this, we intend to rationalise the options in the application system, and simplify the choices that can be exercised by the applicants, including the choice between subvented RCHE and bought place scheme places.\n", "\nWith the financial assistance provided through the Enhanced Bought Place Scheme, the service quality of participating private RCHEs have improved significantly.\n", "\nWe understand that elderly people admitted into these homes, and their family members were generally satisfied with the service quality.\n", "\nThe Social Welfare Department (SWD) is conducting detailed briefings and arranging familiarisation visits for caseworkers and elderly so that they can gain first-hand knowledge of the quality of the private RCHEs taking part in the Bought Place Scheme.\n", "\nSWD will implement the rationalised admission system after extensive consultation.\n", "\nEND/Wednesday, May 19,

this opening address today.\n", "\nI am sure that many of you have attended previous talks about the Y2K problem and the risk it poses.\n", "\nIt is beyond doubt that the Y2K problem is very real, has in some cases been very difficult to detect and in many cases has been very expensive and time consuming to remedy.\n", "\nThere have been widely varying estimates about the severity of the consequences if governments, industries and businesses do not adequately deal with this problem.\n", "\nIt is also now beyond doubt that the potential for risk does in fact depend very much on the consequences that could follow from the failure of critical computer systems.\n", "\nHaving been awakened to the seriousness of the Y2K problem, responsible organizations should by now have completed or nearly completed their rectification projects or have contingency plans in place should their computer systems fail.\n", "\nThe Government, for its part, has expended much effort and money to ensure that its own house is in order.\n", "\nAs at 25 October 1999, all Government's mission-critical computers and embedded systems had been confirmed to be Y2K compliant or rectified.\n", "\nContingency plans are also in place to ensure that essential services to the public will not be disrupted.\n", "\nCompared to the very large IT systems within other Government Departments, the Department of Justice has had an easier task in identifying and rectifying its Y2K problem.\n", "\nEven so, we have had to spend millions of dollars in upgrading the software and hardware for over 20 different systems, including our basic network operating system, e-mail system and document management system.\n", "\nIn the event of any failure in the computer systems of the Department of Justice, probably the greatest impact would be on internal communication.\n", "\nOur computers have also been used for recording hearing dates, debts owed to the Government and repayment dates, time limits for taking legal action and enforcing judgements.\n", "\nHowever, I am glad to inform you that the Department of Justice has already completed the rectification projects, and contingency plans are in place.\n", "\nDuring the analysis stage of our Department's Y2K preparations, we discovered that many of our major 'package' software systems that were installed in 1994-96 were not Y2K compliant.\n", "\nThe existence of the Y2K problem had been identified well before those years and we were perhaps naive at that time to expect that the major software suppliers would have had dealt with the matter.\n", "\nThe Government in 1996 began to add provisions in its IT contracts to require Y2K compliance.\n", "\nHowever, in the case of packaged software this was not always practicable, because the products we needed were simply not yet available in Y2K compliant form.\n", "\nWe either had to accept products which were not Y2K compliant and rely on non-binding assurances from the suppliers that they would have upgrades and patches in time for installation before 1 January 2000, or to delay our projects.\n", "\nIt was fortunate that the major software suppliers have provided the upgrades or patches, but at extra effort and expenses to the customers.\n", "\nThe Government has also taken steps to alert organizations in Hong Kong of the need to examine their technology environments for any potential Y2K problem and take remedial action if necessary.\n", "\nOur Year 2000 Web site provides much useful information about the Y2K problem and links to other Web sites around the world.\n", "\nThe Government has included non-government organizations in its Y2K monitoring programme to help ensure that the essential services provided by them will not be interrupted.\n", "\n9 September 1999 has been generally considered to be one of the critical dates for the smooth transition of computer systems to year 2000.\n", "\nFor the rollover to 9 September, the Government had set up a Central Co-ordinating Centre (CCC) to monitor the territory-wide situation, to co-ordinate cross-sector emergency responses to Y2K-induced incidents, as well as to collect, collate and disseminate information.\n", "\nWe are glad that the CCC had not received any reports on Y2K-induced incidents.\n", "\nThe experience gained from the operation on 9 September would help the Government and all concerned to set up an effective monitoring and co-ordinating mechanism during the rollover to the new millennium.\n", "\nThe Government has already done a lot to prepare for Y2K, and will continue with its endeavour.\n", "\nHowever, that still cannot exclude the possibility of unexpected incidents occurring, and we have to remain on guard.\n", "\nThat there will be litigation arising from the Y2K problem is no longer in doubt.\n", "\nIn the United States, some companies have already brought lawsuits against their insurance companies, claiming the costs of rectification arising from the Y2K problem.\n", "\nSome people take that view that the disputes which could be caused by Y2K are very unusual, unprecedented and widespread, and therefore it is necessary to consider legislating.\n", "\nOn 16 July this year, the Legislative Council held a debate on a motion in respect of the Y2K problem.\n", "\nIn this motion, it was proposed, among other things, that the Administration should study whether it was necessary to introduce legislation on the legal responsibilities arising from Y2K.\n", "\nThe Administration has already given careful consideration to this issue and takes the view that it is unnecessary to introduce legislation.\n", "\nIn principle, the commercial disputes arising from Y2K would not be substantially different from disputes arising from other commercial transactions, and could be dealt with according to the existing legal principles.\n", "\nIf new specific legislation were to be enacted to provide for legal responsibilities, the legislation certainly would involve a lot of controversies and complex elements.\n", "\nMuch discussion and consultation would also be necessary.\n", "\nLegislation is therefore unlikely to provide any solution within a short period of time.\n", "\nOn the contrary, during the legislative process, some people, or even most people, would most probably direct their efforts towards studying how to protect their own interests or evade responsibilities under the new law, instead of dealing with the Y2K problem.\n", "\nFrom the result of voting in the Legislative Council on 16 July, we understand that a majority of the Legislative Councillors also took the view that it was not necessary to consider legislating for the Y2K problem.\n", "\nThe applications of existing legal principles, including those in relation to contract, tort and insurance, to the Y2K problem would of course involve some challenging and interesting issues.\n", "\nThe symposium today will be addressing legal issues which may arise if the Y2K problem causes actual damage.\n", "\nThese include:\n", "\n1. Does anyone have a legal responsibility to compensate for the damage?\n", "\n2. At this late date can one still do anything to prepare for the potential legal rights and liabilities, if any?\n", "\n3. As for persons in the middle of the \"technology chain\", would they become potential plaintiffs, or potential defendants, or both?\n", "\nThe topics to be discussed today also include \"alternative dispute resolution\" which operates outside the traditional judicial system.\n", "\nWhile I of course have full faith in the competence of our judiciary to handle complex issues, parties concerned may prefer to use \"alternative dispute resolution\" forums such as mediation or arbitration.\n", "\nThese are fair, quick and cost-effective means of dispute resolution.\n", "\nThe use of these means should be encouraged.\n", "\nAs far as I know, many information technology contracts, including those in use in Hong Kong, have already contained provisions requiring the parties concerned to resort first to these means of dispute resolution when disputes take place.\n", "\nI believe that when any person first hears about Y2K, it is quite difficult to understand why the omission of two numerals from computer programmes could cause widespread confusion, losses or even catastrophe, and why, at the stroke of midnight at the end of this year, our calendars would suddenly flip back a century to 1900.\n", "\nThis sounds more like science fiction than science.\n", "\nNevertheless, we certainly cannot treat this problem as science fiction, and all of us should prepare well for it.\n", "\nLast but not least, I wish all participants in this symposium a day filled with useful information and ideas.\n", "\nI wish this symposium every success.\n"], "20000101_014.e": ["\nY2K: Customs operation

upsurge in our interceptions made at the airport, land and marine boundaries,\" he went on.\n", "\nSo far this year, Customs officers had intercepted some 800,000 CDs at these boundary points, he noted.\n", "\n\"We are also putting tremendous pressure on pirated CD retail outlets in notorious shopping arcades,\" he said.\n", "\nApart from the 300 odd officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau, the Department has set up a 185-member Special Task Force to tackle the piracy problem on the street level.\n", "\nThe Special Task Force, drawing resources from other Customs formations to make up a 300 strong team on any major outing, launched its first territory-wide anti-piracy operation on June 30, Mr Tsang said.\n", "\n\"Up to the end of August, just in a mere two months' time, some 750 shops have been raided, over 600 people arrested, and two million pirated products seized,\" he added.\n", "\nHe noted that due to the heightened enforcement pressure against the sale of pirated CDs, officers of the Special Task Force had encountered increasing resistance by illicit operators.\n", "\nMr Tsang, however, maintained that the resistance would not affect morale of the officers but helped to strengthen their resolve.\n", "\nSpeaking on police involvement in tackling the retail sale of pirated and counterfeit goods, Mr Tsang said Customs had a close working relationship with the Police.\n", "\n\"Joint operations are mounted from time to time with raids at shopping arcades and hawking areas.\n", "\nIn addition, the Police and Customs have a standing arrangement of exchanging intelligence on IPR violations on a weekly basis,\" he added.\n", "\nHe noted that the use of repeated enforcement actions in the notorious black spots had proved its effectiveness.\n", "\n\"We have now broken the back of the illicit business in the popular areas.\n", "\nVendors of pirated CDs have been forced out of their mainstream bases to operate underground, or to resort to very short-term leases in long vacated premises.\n", "\n\"We intend to do even more on the legislative side to enhance our enforcement,\" he stressed.\n", "\nThe proposals, he cited, included amendments to make unauthorised recordings in cinemas an offence, to broaden the definition of infringing activities to include anything other than those intended for personal and domestic purposes, to incorporate copyright and counterfeiting offences into the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance for the purposes of attracting heavier penalties and forfeiture of monetary proceeds from such illegal activities.\n", "\n\"We are also considering other amendments which will help facilitate enforcement.\n", "\nObviously, the degree of severity of these measures would have to be acceptable to the public,\" he said.\n", "\nOn courts punishment, Mr Tsang said, \"our courts also consider that IPR protection is critical for the protection of our society.\"\n", "\nHe added they had handed down heavy sentences to underline their resolve.\n", "\n\"Recent sentences reached as high as 39 months of imprisonment and $1.04 million of fine.\n", "\nBoth cases concerned manufacturing of infringing CDs,\" he noted.\n", "\nTurning to the role played by the industry in protecting intellectual property, Mr Tsang emphasized that the success of their strategy rested with the commitment of the industry.\n", "\nCustoms was the sole enforcement agent for the statutory offences, he explained, adding that the primary responsibility for the protection of the rights rested invariable with the property rights owners who could take civil litigations against unauthorised exploitation of those rights.\n", "\n\"We maintain our already close working relationship with the industry,\" he said.\n", "\nCustoms has been managing the Anti-Piracy Reward Scheme funded by the industry since 1998 and some $1.3 million of reward money has been paid so far for information leading to successful prosecutions.\n", "\nThe Commissioner said the industry had been very supportive in general in helping the Department verify the authenticity of the seized CDs and provide the necessary administrative support in criminal prosecution.\n", "\n\"In June this year, we have jointly launched with the Business Software Alliance the Genuine Software Action Campaign to give recognition to organisations with good internal software management,\" he continued.\n", "\nHe noted that the programme had generated a great deal of interest in the community.\n", "\nMr Tsang noted that the piracy problem could not be uprooted by mere stringent enforcement alone.\n", "\n\"Incessant demand from the public will sustain the illicit trade, thereby nullifying the enforcement efforts and bringing irrevocable damage to Hong Kong's economy and reputation,\" he explained.\n", "\nThe long-term solution, therefore, rested with education in changing people's mentality, and in raising respect for intellectual property, he concluded.\n"], "19980530_011.e": ["\n'Letter from HK' by Secretary for Trade and Industry\n", "\nFollowing is the English translation of the \"Letter from Hong Kong\" by the Secretary for Trade and Industry, Mr Chau Tak Hay, broadcast on RTHK's Radio 1 this (Saturday) morning:\n", "\nThere has been a lot of discussion in the media and among the public about optical disc copyright piracy.\n", "\nSome people said the Government had made the problem worse with inadequate enforcement; some said that the copyright industry, in particular the audio visual sector, should review the quality and pricing of their products; some even said the considerable profits of the pirates would lure the unemployed into the illicit trade.\n", "\nI was asked at a press conference on 1 May whether \"the Government was trying to shift its responsibilities in fight copyright piracy onto ordinary citizens\"; and that \"cheaper, pirated goods were the natural choices for less well-paid people during a economic down-turn\".\n", "\nI regret to see such dis-respect about intellectual property rights.\n", "\nThere are people who buy and knowingly use pirated movies or computer software without feeling any sense of guilt, sometimes even bragging about the act.\n", "\nThis is not how a responsible and righteous man will behave, nor an act we should see in a healthy society.\n", "\nBoth the Government and the right owners have a role in combating copyright piracy, but it is also important that they have the support of the masses.\n", "\nIntellectual property rights are intangible, private rights; they should be respected and protected by law like physical property rights before we could encourage new inventions, or cultivate creative work in the audio-visual fields.\n", "\nThese private property rights are the foundations of Hong Kong's prosperity.\n", "\nCopyright pirates will jeopardize our business and creative environment, making it unsafe for new products and the life blood of inventors, and damage Hong Kong's hard-won reputation as a major business and financial centre.\n", "\nIt is the public who suffers when our economy suffers.\n", "\nLet me take the film industry as an example.\n", "\nWhile copyright piracy is not the sole reason behind the decline of our film industry, the pirates have nonetheless dealt it a severe blow.\n", "\nMaking movies will need millions in capital; the proper return of investment is of course an issue for consideration, so are the efforts of all those behind and in front of the camera.\n", "\nThe viewers should understand that the copyright pirates are hijacking all these efforts.\n", "\nAccording to estimates of the film industry, the pirates accounted for a 30% decrease in box offices, or approximately $300 million.\n", "\nThe losses rose to $1 billion if overseas distribution was also included.\n", "\nSince the profits of the pirates do not go back to the movie companies, the decrease in return and increase in risk are putting off investors.\n", "\nThis is adversely affecting the livelihood of those working for movies and indirectly suffocating the development of the industry.\n", "\nHong Kong produced more than 200 movies a year in its hey day, mesmerizing viewers in southeast Asia.\n", "\nWe will not want to see a drain of our talents from Hong Kong and the fall of the \"Eastern Hollywood\".\n", "\nFor the same reason, pirated compact discs hit the music industry badly, stripping the creators and performers of their deserved return, hindering creativity and affecting the livelihood of people in the industry (including the artists).\n", "\nWe should realise that good creations and artists can only come from a healthy music industry.\n", "\nThe real way to support your idols is to walk away from pirated copies.\n", "\nAnother cornerstone of Hong Kong's prosperity is the rule of law.\n", "\nAll civil and criminal action can only proceed under the law.\n", "\nThe Government has in the past year greatly strengthened the laws protecting intellectual property rights.\n", "\nFor example, Customs' capabilities to enforce against copyright piracy were enhanced under the Copyright Ordinance enacted in June 1997.\n", "\nThe maximum penalty for possessing for trade or business purposes pirated articles is imprisonment of 4 years and a fine of $50 000 per infringing article.\n", "\nThe maximum penalty for manufacturing pirated articles is imprisonment of 8 years and a fine of $500 000.\n", "\nI am glad that the courts are handing down heavier sentences for copyright offences.\n", "\nThis shows the judiciary understands the evil that copyright piracy is doing against Hong Kong.\n", "\nI hope to see more heavier sentences as a deterrent.\n", "\nThe effectiveness of the protection for intellectual property hinges on the law and the enforcement.\n", "\nThis is why we see so much in vigorous enforcement action.\n", "\nWe are glad that at the retail level, copyright piracy at some notorious blackspots have subsided under raids by Customs.\n", "\nAlthough the mobility of the pirates and the demand for pirated goods have added to our enforcement difficulties, Customs will continue to raid other blackspots, and where necessary, join hands with the Police and other Government departments in their enforcement action.\n", "\nApart from the retail level, we also target copyright piracy at source.\n", "\nSince last December, licences are required for the import and export of optical disc manufacturing equipment.\n", "\nThis will enable Customs to better trace the movements of such equipment, preventing their being used illegitimately.\n", "\nThe Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance, enacted in March, further requires all optical disc manufacturers to be licensed by Customs, and adds a mandatory requirement for all optical discs manufactured in Hong Kong to bear a permanent source identification code.\n", "\nThis allows Customs to effectively monitor the optical disc manufacturing industry and guard against piracy.\n", "\nI have signed the commencement notice for the Ordinance, and it has already come into operation on 29 May.\n", "\nThe optical disc manufacturers will have a grace period of three months to apply for licences and comply with the source identification coding requirement.\n", "\nI hope you are beginning to understand that not only the Customs or the right owners, but cooperation of all is required to effectively protect intellectual property rights and to combat copyright piracy or trade mark counterfeiting.\n", "\nSome may ask if the Government could enact more severe laws to punish the pirates and introduce a deterrent.\n", "\nIt is imperative that a responsible Government should carefully consider every possible solution to a problem.\n", "\nWe are now considering whether to introduce new provisions in addition to the existing legal framework.\n", "\nFor example, legal liabilities for buyers of pirated products or confiscating criminal proceeds of the pirates are two proposals under our scrutiny.\n", "\nI have to emphasize that we have not reached any conclusions in respect of any proposals and we will not take any moves lightly.\n", "\nI can assure you that every aspect will be examined in detail, and we will also consult the public and the copyright industry.\n", "\nHowever, we should now concentrate on effectively implementing our existing law.\n", "\nWe all know that we could not litigate or prosecute for each and every ailment .\n", "\nIn any advanced society, a high level of civic education will engender respect for other people.\n", "\nEducation is the ultimate solution to copyright piracy.\n", "\nWhile education is a long-term effort, we have already taken our first steps, in collaboration with the copyright industry, and started explaining to students the importance of protecting intellectual property rights.\n", "\nIntellectual property rights are the pillars of the economy in the 21st century and the rule of the game in international trade.\n", "\nNew products and services are the hot commodities of the international market; the continued growth and development of Hong Kong depend on continued improvement and development of high value-added items.\n", "\nThe fruits of such creativity will in turn depend on the cooperation of the Government, the authors and creators, and our fellow citizens.\n", "\nCopyright piracy destroys Hong Kong's creative edge, we must be determined in our fight against piracy in order to protect Hong Kong's international trading

Asian Regional Symposium today (Monday):\n", "\nThe Challenge of Piracy and Counterfeiting\n", "\nMr Sabharwal, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,\n", "\nI am very pleased to be able to take part in this important symposium today.\n", "\nMeeting the challenge of piracy and counterfeiting will remain high on the agenda of many Asian governments.\n", "\nI am therefore especially grateful for this opportunity to share with you Hong Kong's experience in dealing with the complex subject of protecting intellectual property rights.\n", "\nThe Importance of Intellectual Property Rights Protection\n", "\nWithin the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, policy responsibility for intellectual property rights protection falls within my portfolio as the Secretary for Trade and Industry.\n", "\nThis is a reflection of our recognition of the fact that intellectual property rights protection is an essential element in the development of trade, investment and technology transfer.\n", "\nWe have for long recognised that it is very much in Hong Kong's own interest to protect intellectual property rights.\n", "\nAnd we do not have to look far for the reasons.\n", "\nMuch of our economy depends on the creativity of our people.\n", "\nWhether we are talking about fashion, toys, watches or jewellery, which together account for a large chunk of our exports, much of the value added has come from the design of the products.\n", "\nWe are also one of the largest exporters of cinema films in the world.\n", "\nI can go on to list other examples.\n", "\nBut the underlying message should be abundantly clear.\n", "\nOur economic well-being depends on the brain power of our people.\n", "\nAttempts to steal the intellectual property attaching to the products and services of our legitimate businesses amount to attempts to undermine our economic viability.\n", "\nHong Kong is also an excellent destination for foreign investment.\n", "\nOur attractions are manifold.\n", "\nAmong those most commonly cited are our superb physical infrastructure, our simple tax regime and low tax rates, our well developed financial support services and regulatory system, the rule of law and in general a very business-friendly environment.\n", "\nThere are of course many ingredients in a business-friendly environment, but many internationally renowned surveys count the existence of a reliable system for the effective protection of intellectual property rights as an integral part of such an environment.\n", "\nThis is natural.\n", "\nInvestors need peace of mind about the protection of their legitimate interests.\n", "\nThey will be deterred if they are worried that their orders will be over-produced for channeling to the illegal market or that their inventions will be copied without authorization.\n", "\nFor us to sustain and sharpen our attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment and reap the benefits of technology upgrading and wealth creation, intellectual property protection is not a luxury, but a must.\n", "\nAnother relevant consideration in this equation is the future of our economic development.\n", "\nOver the past two decades, Hong Kong has undergone a restructuring of its economy.\n", "\nMany of the more labour and land intensive assembly processes have been relocated to our hinterland in Southern China, or even further north.\n", "\nThis has allowed us to become a command centre for much offshore production while retaining and developing higher value-added manufacturing and services in Hong Kong.\n", "\nDespite the recent setbacks resulting from the Asian financial turmoil, there can be no denying that our economic development over the last 20 years or so has been a resounding success.\n", "\nOur standard of living has improved considerably as a consequence.\n", "\nBut competition is keen in the Region.\n", "\nIf we are to sustain and uplift our standard of living, we cannot seek to compete on low value added processes or cheap labour and land.\n", "\nWe have to be able to build a technology-based and knowledge-based economy.\n", "\nAn increasing proportion of the value added will have to come from innovation - not only in respect of products, but also in respect of processes and application; not only in respect of manufacturing, but also in respect of services.\n", "\nNo one will however be prepared to invest their time and effort in innovation if the output is easily stolen.\n", "\nIt is therefore critical that a robust regime of intellectual property protection is in place to support our economic development into the 21st century.\n", "\nI realize that I may well be preaching to the converted.\n", "\nHowever, I believe that many of the considerations applicable to Hong Kong are equally applicable to other economies in the Region and, indeed, in the rest of the world.\n", "\nHong Kong may have moved a little faster than some of our neighbours in recognizing that we cannot compete on cost alone.\n", "\nBut if our experience is anything to go by, it is only a question of time when an economy has to move from relying solely on cheap land and labour.\n", "\nClimbing up the value added ladder is the way forward.\n", "\nSo the pressure to protect intellectual property will increasingly come from internal rather than external forces.\n", "\nAgainst this background, and in an increasingly globalized world economy, different countries and territories face many common problems in protecting intellectual property rights.\n", "\nFor example, the ease of transport has inadvertently facilitated, among other perfectly worthy and legitimate causes, cross-border shipments of pirated and counterfeit goods.\n", "\nAdvances in technology have also enabled pirates to make infringing copies more easily than before.\n", "\nThis underlines the need for economies in the Region to meet regularly to examine and re-examine the problem and together lay down effective strategies to deal with changing situations.\n", "\nTackling the Problem\n", "\nI now turn to how we in Hong Kong tackle the problem of piracy and counterfeiting.\n", "\nEssentially we have a multiple-pronged approach: legislation, enforcement, education and cooperation with intellectual property rights owners.\n", "\n(a) Legislation\n", "\nAs I have just said, the nature of the piracy problem is changing.\n", "\nWe have to ensure that our laws remain relevant to changing circumstances.\n", "\nWe also need to provide our enforcement officers with the proper legal tools to carry out their work effectively.\n", "\nOn 1 July, 1997, Hong Kong was reunited with the Mainland of China.\n", "\nTo prepare for the transition, we had to establish a new, independent set of laws for the protection of intellectual property rights.\n", "\nThree ordinances were passed in June 1997 - the Copyright Ordinance, the Registered Designs Ordinance and the Patents Ordinance.\n", "\nThis was no easy task.\n", "\nIn the formulation of these laws, we had put in a great deal of effort to make them meet the highest possible standards in line with international norms.\n", "\nI am pleased to say that our new laws now meet the standards set down in the Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, or the TRIPS Agreement as it is commonly known, of the World Trade Organisation.\n", "\nInternational standards apart, we have always been mindful to take account of Hong Kong's own specific circumstances in approaching our legislative work.\n", "\nFor example, the high concentration of population here facilitates the selling of goods to a relatively large number of customers within a relatively short time, thus increasing the temptation for pirates to make and sell pirated copies or counterfeit goods.\n", "\nWe therefore believe that penalties for piracy and counterfeiting should be set at an appropriately high level to have the necessary deterrent effect.\n", "\nThus, under the Copyright Ordinance, the maximum penalty for possessing infringing copies for trade or business is a fine of HK$50,000 per infringing copy and imprisonment for up to four years.\n", "\nPossession of \"plates\" for manufacturing infringing copies is subject to a maximum penalty of HK$500,000 in fine and imprisonment for eight years.\n", "\nTo enable us to deal more effectively with the piracy problem at source, we amended the subsidiary legislation of our Import and Export Ordinance last December to introduce a licensing requirement for the importation and exportation of equipment for manufacturing optical discs.\n", "\nIn March this year, the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance was enacted.\n", "\nIt requires all optical disc manufacturers to obtain a license from the Government, and adds a mandatory requirement for all locally manufactured optical discs to bear a source identification code.\n", "\nManufacturing optical discs without a valid license or forgery of a source code carries a maximum penalty of a fine of HK$500,000 and two years' imprisonment for a first conviction.\n", "\nThe penalties will double for repeat convictions.\n", "\nThe aim of these moves is to let the government keep better track of the production of optical discs, to distinguish legitimate businesses from illegal ones and to empower the enforcement agencies to tackle the problem at the production level.\n", "\nWe believe that, over time, the effect of these measures will filter down to, and reduce the problem at, the retail level.\n", "\nb) Enforcement\n", "\nCombating piracy and counterfeiting is a demanding task and is manpower intensive.\n", "\nTo make sure we have enough hands available, we will have doubled the number of officers in the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau of our Customs and Excise Department from 117 in 1994 to 237 in 1999.\n", "\nThe Bureau will be one of the most powerful intellectual property rights enforcement agencies in the Region.\n", "\nBesides controlling the problem at the production level, our dedicated enforcement officers also attack the problem at the distribution and retail levels.\n", "\nOur Customs officers conduct frequent territory-wide raids against retail outlets.\n", "\nIn this effort they are assisted by other law enforcement agencies from time to time.\n", "\nIn the first five months of this year, our law enforcement officers seized more than 28 million suspected pirated optical discs.\n", "\nRetail piracy in some of the more notorious shopping arcades has subsided under our persistent enforcement efforts.\n", "\nAt the importation and distribution levels, our law enforcement officers have conducted many successful raids on storage premises and stepped up enforcement actions at various border control points.\n", "\nWe are also strengthening our work in the gathering of intelligence and are maintaining close contact with other enforcement authorities, including those in the Mainland.\n", "\nWe can be proud of our enforcement work.\n", "\nThrough these examples, I hope you can see not only our determination to combat the problem of intellectual property rights infringement, but also the considerable amount of resources and efforts that we have put in to fight this continuing battle.\n", "\n(c) Education\n", "\nMany experts in the audience will agree with me that no amount of legislation and enforcement is sufficient if the public continues to demand cheap pirated and counterfeit goods.\n", "\nWe therefore see public education as an equally important area of work in intellectual property rights protection.\n", "\nWe believe in the need to educate our public to respect intellectual property rights from an early age.\n", "\nThus we have started a series of education programmes to drive home the message.\n", "\nStarting from last September, the Intellectual Property Department has been visiting secondary schools and talking to students directly about the importance of intellectual property protection.\n", "\nBy the end of May, officers of the department have already visited 93 schools and talked to 25,000 students.\n", "\nDuring such talks, we cover the concept of intellectual property and the importance of its protection.\n", "\nWe also put great emphasis on going beyond mere theory and on exploring one's own potential and creativity.\n", "\nIf our young people realize the pleasure of enjoying the fruits of their own hard work, they will gradually take their own initiative to protect intellectual property rights.\n", "\n(d) Cooperation with Intellectual Property Rights Owners\n", "\nIntellectual property rights are private economic rights.\n", "\nAt the end of the day, it is critically important that we have the full cooperation of rights owners or their agents.\n", "\nI am pleased to say that we have done quite well in this regard.\n", "\nRights owners and their representatives have on the whole been forthcoming in helping us to identify infringing copies, for example.\n", "\nI believe that there is further scope in such cooperation.\n", "\nOur public education drive is a case in point.\n", "\nIndeed we are maintaining a regular dialogue with rights owners and other interested parties on this and other issues of mutual concern.\n", "\nChallenges Ahead\n", "\nI would now like to turn to future developments in protecting intellectual property rights and how we can further build on the foundation that we have laid.\n", "\nI believe that the problem of piracy of optical discs will continue to be an area of concern in the next few years.\n", "\nWhether we like it or not, the demand is still there.\n", "\nAnd the potentially huge profit is a major incentive for pirates.\n", "\nTo keep the problem under control, regional cooperation to stop cross-border shipments of infringing goods is necessary.\n", "\nWe look forward to closer ties among enforcement authorities in the Region in this respect.\n", "\nAnother area of concern is the problem of piracy on the Internet.\n", "\nHong Kong is probably one of very few places which extend their copyright protection to materials on the Internet.\n", "\nNonetheless, even the most advanced of economies will acknowledge that there are many technical problems on the enforcement side.\n", "\nTo address this, we should ensure that we have qualified personnel who have the necessary computer knowledge, technological expertise and professional training to enable them to identify piracy and find ways to tackle the problem.\n", "\nIn addition, regional enforcement agencies and the computer industry will need to come together to find out how to employ technical means to bar illegal duplication of materials and how to equip enforcement officers with the tools to identify and track down infringement.\n", "\nAgain, regional cooperation is an important element in our efforts.\n", "\nCrime in the digital environment is not confined to copyright piracy.\n", "\nPhysical communication and transport among economies is improving.\n", "\nThe Internet is increasingly being used by illegal businesses to provide electronically-hidden mail-order services for counterfeit articles; and by computer hackers to gain unauthorised commercial information and break open trade secrets.\n", "\nThese are all areas where we should prepare ourselves to move forward together in the future.\n", "\nWe should also consider ways to make the proof of copyright subsistence easier.\n", "\nOne possibility is to set up an international centralised copyright rights-management information system.\n", "\nThe concept is not a compulsory copyright registration system, but a voluntary database to assist the world's copyright owners to manage and assert their rights, as and when they need to.\n", "\nBy registering rights - particularly licenses and assignments - with such a system, rights owners and enforcement agencies from around the world would be able to have easier access to the verification of copyright, thus facilitating prosecution, and resulting in better protection of the interests of the rights owners.\n", "\nThere are of course many problems, both technical and legal, to be addressed in developing this concept.\n", "\nI would invite all of you to give further thought to the subject.\n", "\nFinally, we should study the suggestion to broaden legal liability in copyright piracy and counterfeiting to combat the problem of piracy at the consumer level.\n", "\nFor example, we are studying the possibility of applying closure orders to premises found with the production, distribution or trading of pirated and counterfeiting goods.\n", "\nWe also suspect that if we do not see a fall in consumer demand for pirated and counterfeit articles, we may have to visit the question of whether the consumer can continue to be given unlimited freedom to create market demand for illegal articles with such impunity.\n", "\nThese are controversial issues that cannot be dealt with lightly and we will need to ensure that all relevant considerations are taken into account.\n", "\nConclusion\n", "\nWe believe in an integrated approach to counter piracy and counterfeiting in the short term as well as in the longer term.\n", "\nOnly by such commitment could creativity, talent, trade and industry flourish.\n", "\nI hope that I have been able to provide some points for discussion during this Symposium as well as after it.\n", "\nI look forward to learning from your contributions.\n", "\nThank you.\n"], "19980117_002.e": ["\nHK disappointed at remaining on copyright watch list \n", "\nThe Government

WTO, the USA and the HKSAR.\n", "\nMr Chau said that the three ordinances together with the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance which was enacted in March this year, provided the HKSAR Government's enforcement officers with legal tools to carry out their work more effectively.\n", "\nIn addition, penalties for piracy and counterfeiting had been set at an appropriate high level to have the necessary deterrent effect.\n", "\nMr Chau said legislation was one of the aspects of the HKSAR Government's multiple-prong approach to tackle the problem of piracy and counterfeiting.\n", "\nOther aspects included enforcement, education and co-operation with intellectual property rights owners.\n", "\nThe number of staff of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau of the Customs and Excise Department would be doubled from 117 in 1994 to 237 in 1999.\n", "\nThe Bureau would be one of the most powerful intellectual property rights enforcement agencies within the Asian region, he said.\n", "\n\"In the first five months of 1998, our enforcement officers seized more than 28 million suspected pirated optical discs.\n", "\nAs a result, retail piracy in some of the more notorious shopping arcades has subsided.\n", "\n\"We are also strengthening our work in the gathering of intelligence and are maintaining close contact with other enforcement authorities, including those in the mainland,\" he said.\n", "\nMr Chau said the HKSAR Government was well aware that no amount of legislation and enforcement was sufficient if the public continued to demand cheap pirated and counterfeit good.\n", "\nThus, it had started a series of education and publicity programmes to drive home the message.\n", "\nHe said the Government had good co-operation with intellectual property rights owners and there could be further co-operation in its public education drive.\n", "\nTurning to challenges ahead, Mr Chau said that the problem of piracy of optical discs would continue to be an area of concern in the next few years.\n", "\nAnd the potentially huge profit was a major incentive for pirates.\n", "\nTo keep the problem under control, regional co-operation to stop cross-border shipments of infringing goods was necessary.\n", "\nHe looked forward to closer ties among enforcement authorities in the Asian region in this respect.\n", "\nHe pointed out that another area of concern was the problem of piracy on the Internet.\n", "\n\"Regional enforcement agencies and the computer industry will need to come together to find out how to employ technical means to bar illegal duplication of materials and how to equip enforcement officers with the tools to identify and track down infringement.\n", "\nAgain, regional co-operation is an important element in our efforts,\" he said.\n", "\nMr Chau added that the Internet was increasingly being used by illegal businesses to provide electronically-hidden mail-order services for counterfeit articles; and by computer hackers to gain unauthorised commercial information and break open trade secrets.\n", "\n\"These are all areas where we should prepare ourselves to move forward together in the future.\n", "\n\"We should also consider ways to make the proof of copyright subsistence easier.\n", "\n\"One possibility is to set up an international centralised copyright rights-management information system.\n", "\n\"By registering rights - particularly licenses and assignments - with such a system, rights owners and enforcement agencies from around the world would be able to have easier access to the verification of copyright, thus facilitating prosecution, and resulting in better protection of the interests of the rights owners, \" Mr Chau said.\n", "\nFinally, Mr Chau said a suggestion to broaden legal liability in copyright piracy and counterfeiting to combat the problem of piracy at the consumer level should be studied.\n", "\nNoting that many considerations had to be taken into account in pursuing the various challenges, Mr Chau invited the delegates to consider these important issues and contribute their views and ideas on how to take them forward.\n"]}, "Group_551":

immunity against the disease while surveillance for influenza in human and in poultry should be maintained and international collaboration intensified.\"\n", "\nDr Saw pointed out that the avian flu virus could have spread and caused an influenza pandemic if decisive and vigorous actions had not been taken in Hong Kong.\n", "\nActions taken in Hong Kong in the past year had gained time for scientists to find out more about the virus.\n", "\n\"According to available evidence, it has been clearly established that the primary mode of transmission is a direct one from birds to humans,\" he said.\n", "\n\"Out of the 1 366 poultry samples collected in markets just before the mass chicken slaughter, nearly 19 per cent of samples from chickens and about 2 per cent from ducks were found to contain the virus.\"\n", "\nResults of studies available so far confirmed that the primary mode of transmission of H5N1 infection is from poultry to man, most likely through contact with the faeces of poultry.\n", "\nCohort studies showed that transmission of the virus from person-to-person had occurred but was uncommon and inefficient.\n", "\nThere is no evidence that H5N1 infection is transmitted to man from raw, chilled or frozen poultry foods.\n", "\nOn measures taken to contain the outbreak and to monitor the situation, Dr Saw said a whole host of measures had been taken in Hong Kong with the joint efforts of a number of government departments, the Hospital Authority and academics from the universities.\n", "\nThe Department of Health's (DH) surveillance for influenza, which picked up the first index case in the world last year, had been extended to all public hospitals, all 63 general out-patients clinics and 29 general practitioners since December last year.\n", "\nIn the past year, some 18 000 specimens had been received and tested for influenza A. \n", "\nNone of them, except those taken from case patients, were positive for H5N1.\n", "\nThis enhanced surveillance system played a major part in monitoring the situation and would trigger off action where necessary.\n", "\nOn the curative side, the Hospital Authority had devoted great efforts in providing quality medical care to each patient during the outbreak.\n", "\nThree centres were designated to provide rapid diagnosis for influenza A for all public hospitals with preliminary results reported within 24 hours.\n", "\nThe mass chicken slaughter launched by the HKSARG between December 29 and 31, 1997 proved to be very effective in eradicating the virus.\n", "\nThe latest date of onset for a human case of avian flu was December 28, 1997, one day before the mass chicken slaughter was launched.\n", "\nTo ensure a safe supply of poultry upon restocking, stringent controls on import of chicken and other poultry had been introduced by the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) prior to and after the resumption of import of these poultry into the territory.\n", "\nThis had so far been working smoothly.\n", "\nOver 200 000 blood samples have been examined.\n", "\nNo evidence of active infection with avian influenza had been detected in any consignment of imported poultry.\n", "\nOn the local front, on-farm testing of birds was introduced for poultry on farms, along with new licensing conditions covering hygiene and management practices.\n", "\nAll flocks are serologically tested during the growing period.\n", "\nAll farms had remained free from infection with H5 influenza so far.\n", "\nTo prevent H5N1 virus being passed on from waterfowl, a potential carrier, to chicken, the policy of segregation of waterfowl from other poultry was introduced in May this year at all levels from import to retail with the support and co-operation of the traders.\n", "\nAll these, together with surveillance on birds and markets conducted by the AFD, had safeguarded the health of poultry and ensured the disease did not occur.\n", "\nGreat emphasis had also been placed in upgrading the hygiene standard of markets at both wholesale and retail level.\n", "\nAdditional requirements and conditions had been imposed by the two municipal services departments on the licensed fresh provision shops and market stalls selling poultry.\n", "\nThese included requirements to use plastic or metal poultry cages instead of wooden cages, provision of refrigerator or chiller for keeping poultry carcasses, water heaters and high pressure water jet cleaner for daily cleansing etc.\n", "\nDr Saw pointed out that the overall hygiene standard of poultry retail outlets is now much improved.\n", "\nEnhancement of hygiene standard is on-going and the poultry retail outlets are subject to regular inspections by the health inspectors.\n", "\nOn the education and publicity front, to enlist the public to combat the avian flu, guidelines for influenza prevention were prepared for doctors, health care workers, schools teachers, staff of child care service units, rehabilitation service units and elderly centres.\n", "\nPeople handling poultry and animal waste were advised on personal hygiene and ways to prevent contact with poultry faecal matter.\n", "\nThese were backed up by general publicity on TV, radio and the printed media.\n", "\nIn addition, Dr Saw pointed out that the Hong Kong SAR Government had launched a \"Healthy Living into the 21st Century Campaign\" which aimed at improving the standards of environmental, food and personal hygiene.\n", "\nThe Campaign will last for three years.\n", "\nLooking ahead, Dr Saw said the Inter-Departmental Co-ordinating Committee had recommended and the Administration had agreed that:\n", "\n* International collaboration in the monitoring and prevention of influenza, involving various specialties and disciplines, should continue.\n", "\n* In Hong Kong, the surveillance for influenza in human population should be continued.\n", "\n* The influenza surveillance in animals, in particular poultry, should be maintained.\n", "\n* The present system of control measures to ensure safe supply of poultry should be maintained.\n", "\nDr Saw concluded that the whole avian flu crisis demonstrated the importance of disease surveillance and control with international collaboration.\n"], "19971207_001.e": ["\nUpdates on H5N1 influenza A situation \n", "\nThe preliminary investigations showed that at this stage,

fully supports the measures being taken.\"\n", "\nTo further enhance surveillance in Hong Kong, Dr Saw said, the Department of Health would extend surveillance coverage to all General Out-patient Clinics.\n", "\nThe Hospital Authority would also set up surveillance in public hospitals.\n", "\nIn the meantime, Dr Saw said, the Agriculture and Fisheries Department had also increased surveillance in poultry in collaboration with The University of Hong Kong.\n", "\nHe said the Department would disseminate to doctors, medical professionals, colleges and health care workers available information

occurred in Hong Kong in March this year suggests that this type of avian flu virus causes relatively mild illness in humans and poses no imminent major threat to public health.\n", "\nThis finding was based on the clinical conditions of the two cases in Hong Kong and preliminary serology studies using blood samples collected from patient contacts, from blood donors and from poultry workers.\n", "\nThese studies were conducted jointly by the Department of Health (DH) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.\n",

was from birds to humans while the possibility of human-to-human transmission remains open.\n", "\nOn the serological study, he pointed out that there was a low prevalence of antibody to the H9N2 viruses isolated from the patients among people screened in contact tracing of patients(0.4 percent), blood donors (0.5 percent) and poultry workers (2 percent) tested.\n", "\nAt the same time, serology tests conducted by the Agriculture and Fisheries Department indicated that a high proportion of poultry in Hong Kong markets had been exposed to H9 virus.\n", "\nHowever, it was noted that the virus usually causes mild symptoms, if any, among birds and poultry and there had been no new cases of influenza caused by H9 virus in humans in Hong Kong.\n", "\nThese, together with the satisfactory outcome and full recovery of the two girls, indicated that the transmission of the isolated H9N2 virus among human is relatively rare and inefficient.\n", "\nHence, the Special Investigation Group comprising of local and overseas medical and veterinary experts and scientists concluded at the present stage that the discovery of H9N2 virus in humans does not appear to pose an imminent major threat to public health.\n", "\nOn poultry workers, Dr Mak commented that test results available so far and other studies being undertaken in other countries suggested that poultry workers may have a higher level of exposure to H9 virus than the general population but this was not unexpected given their close association with poultry on a daily basis.\n", "\nHe stressed that this was no cause for undue alarm as there have been no reported cases of illness caused by avian influenza viruses in this group.\n", "\nHe advised those handling poultry to continue to observe good personal hygiene practices in their daily work.\n", "\nThe Special Investigation Group also noted that sequencing of genes from H9N2 viruses isolated from the patients demonstrate that all genes of

Narcotics, Mrs Clarie Lo, explained that existing drug treatment and rehabilitation centres which provide medical detoxification are registered as nursing homes by the Department of Health under the Hospitals, Nursing Homes and Maternity Homes Ordinance (Cap.165).\n", "\nThe regulatory controls imposed on these medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres as nursing homes include, among others, the accommodation, staffing and equipment used or to be used in such centres which should be fit for the purposes intended.\n", "\nHowever, centres which adopt a non-medical approach in the treatment and rehabilitation of drug abusers are not subject to any registration control.\n", "\n\"There are about 11 non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres in Hong Kong.\n", "\nIt is observed that most of them are accommodated in stone or wooden huts in remote areas.\n", "\nSome of them are also not fitted with proper electricity and water supplies.\n", "\nThus, they would be subject to building, fire safety or environmental health risks should accidents happen,\" Mrs Lo said.\n", "\n\"The management and operation of such centres also vary,\" she added.\n", "\nTaking into account these observations, the Government proposes and the Action Committee Against Narcotics supports that a registration scheme should be introduced for non-medical drug treatment and

rights and welfare of drug patients who, like other drug patients in medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres, are subject to psychological stress and physical health problems when undergoing treatment and rehabilitation.\n", "\nThe staff and treatment approaches adopted by these centres should, therefore, be competent/relevant in providing services to them; and\n", "\n* enable the Government to keep a register of the non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres and to impose requirements and standards for their operations as necessary.\n", "\nTo ensure broadly the same registration standards to be applied to all drug treatment and rehabilitation centres, Mrs Lo said the proposed registration requirements to be introduced for non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres would be similar to those provisions of Cap.165 which currently apply to medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres.\n", "\nThe major registration requirements will include the following:\n", "\n* a person in charge of a drug treatment and rehabilitation centre will need to apply to an authority for registration if the centre provides residential care, treatment and rehabilitation service for drug abusers;\n", "\n* registration of an applicant is subject to the conditions that the drug treatment and rehabilitation centre under application complies with fire safety and building safety requirements as prescribed by the Director of Fire Services and the Director of Buildings respectively (the preliminary requirements have been set out in the consultation document); and\n", "\n* the applicant is fit for operating a drug treatment and rehabilitation centre.\n", "\n(A definition of 'fitness' has been included in the consultation document).\n", "\nFailure to comply with the registration requirements or operating a drug treatment and rehabilitation centre without a registration certificate will be liable to a fine of $1,000 and/or imprisonment for three months.\n", "\nThe registration scheme for non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres will be implemented in phases.\n", "\n\"We consider it not practical to require all of them to be registered at once since most of them will need substantial physical upgrading to meet the proposed registration requirements.\n", "\nIn this respect, they are, no matter subvented or non-subvented, welcomed to apply to the Lotteries Fund for upgrading their facilities or accommodation to meet the necessary requirements,\" Mrs Lo said.\n", "\nThe first phase of the registration scheme will cover those non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres which receive subvention from the Social Welfare Department.\n", "\nOther non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres will be covered in a subsequent phase as some of them might wish to seek other sources of funding.\n", "\nAs regards the registration procedures, Mrs Lo said all operators of non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres would be required to notify the registration authority of their operation within three months after commencement of the enabling legislation.\n", "\nThey will be granted exemption certificates which will provisionally exempt them from registration until such certificates are revoked.\n", "\nFor these non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres covered in the first phase, their exemption certificates will be revoked 48 months after the end of the notification period.\n", "\nDuring this grace period, they are encouraged to obtain a registration certificate from the registration authority as soon as they are ready.\n", "\nIf they fail to obtain a registration certificate by the end of the grace period, they will have to cease operation.\n", "\nAs regards those non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres set up upon or after the commencement of the enabling legislation, the operator will need to apply for registration before starting to provide such services.\n", "\nNon-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres not covered in the first phase will also be granted exemption certificates.\n", "\nThe timing of implementation of the registration scheme for them will be decided in the light of experience gained as these centres have their unique circumstances.\n", "\n\"The registration authority for non-medical drug treatment

Development : Enhancing Global Competitiveness in the Next Millennium\" at the City University of Hong Kong today (Friday).\n", "\nMr Kwong said the rapid development of electronic commerce had been spurred by the exponential growth in the use of the Internet, and was transforming the way in which business was conducted.\n", "\nHe said, \"By leveraging on the latest advances in information technology, telecommunications and multi-media content creation, electronic commerce enables businesses to become more adaptive and responsive to changes in market conditions.\n", "\n\"It also allows them to develop markets globally and more effectively, facilitates their targeting of customers on a localised or even individualised basis, and helps them to improve their management of the entire value chain.\n", "\n\"This means that direct purchases from suppliers or direct marketing of products and services to end consumers is now a lot easier and simpler through electronic commerce over the Internet.\"\n", "\nLooking at the issue from a global perspective, Mr Kwong said Internet users worldwide had grown from 40 million in 1996 to more than 100 million in 1997, and are expected to

business-to-consumer (retail) transactions conducted through electronic means.\n", "\nBased on the latest industry forecast, the total value of electronic transactions on a global basis will rise to over US$400 billion annually by 2002.\n", "\nThe projected growth rate is 40 times that of the global Gross Domestic Product.\n", "\nElectronic commerce is therefore widely recognised as the engine to drive future economic growth.\n", "\nThe development of electronic commerce will enhance our productivity and efficiency, and thereby strengthening our overall competitiveness.\n", "\nCountries around the world are actively promoting the development of electronic commerce.\n", "\nIn order to enable us to interface effectively with our major trading partners who are driving intensively in developing electronic commerce in the Information Age, we must seek to facilitate and promote the development of electronic commerce with the same vigour.\n", "\nElectronic commerce is in its early stage of development in Hong Kong.\n", "\nWith the right environment, it is ready to grow.\n", "\nTo promote the wide adoption of this new mode of doing business, the Government is committed to providing a conducive environment for electronic commerce to take hold and flourish in Hong Kong, and for electronic commerce to be accepted by the community as a part of our daily lives.\n", "\nThe Government is also committed to taking necessary actions to address public concerns about the legal status as well as the security and certainty of electronic transactions.\n", "\nElectronic Transactions Bill\n", "\nThe objectives of drafting the Electronic Transactions Bill are two-fold : first, to establish a clear legal framework to give electronic records and digital signatures the same legal status as that of their paper-based counterparts; and second, to establish a suitable framework for the operation of certifications authorities so as to ensure trust and security in the conduct of electronic transactions.\n", "\nElectronic Records and Digital Signatures\n", "\nTo give electronic records and digital signatures used in electronic transactions the same legal status as that of their paper-based counterparts, we propose to introduce the following provisions in the Bill, along the line of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law - Model Law on Electronic Commerce -\n", "\n(a) where a rule of law requires or permits information to be given or presented in writing, the use of electronic records will satisfy the rule of law;\n", "\n(b) where a rule of law requires information to be retained, or to be presented or retained in the original form, that requirement is met by retaining or presenting the information in the form of electronic records;\n", "\n(c) where a rule of law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met by a digital signature;\n", "\n(d) contracts shall not be denied legal effect solely on the ground that electronic records are used in their formation; and\n", "\n(e) electronic records shall not be denied admissibility as evidence in court on the sole ground that they are electronic records.\n", "\nExemptions\n", "\nWhile it is our policy objective to promote the wider adoption of electronic transactions, we recognise that for the time being certain types of transactions and procedures would preferably be conducted through conventional means for the time being because of their solemnity, significance, complexity or other factors.\n", "\nWe therefore propose to exempt certain generic items from the operation of the relevant provisions in the Bill.\n", "\nThese items include wills, trust, statutory declarations, affidavits, power of attorney, court orders, warrant, bills of exchange, and documents or instruments concerning land or property transactions, etc.\n", "\nIn addition, judicial proceedings will also be exempted from the operation of the relevant provisions inthe Bill.\n", "\nWhen the courts and tribunals have ascertained that electronic information can be accepted in their proceedings in future, the authorities for making court rules may withdraw the relevant exemptions.\n", "\nWe recongise that some Government departments may not be able to accept electronic information under certain rules of law because of operational, technological or other reasons.\n", "\nTo address this, we have proposed a mechanism in the Bill whereby specific rules of law can be exempt from the operation of the relevant provisions in the Bill by means of subsidiary legislation.\n", "\nThe departments concerned will review the exemptions from time to time and consider removing them at appropriate time.\n", "\nWe also recognise that individual departments which can accept electronic information under certain rules of law may only be able to do so if such electronic information has been prepared in a specified format and using a specified type of software.\n", "\nTo deal with such situations, we have also proposed a mechanism in the Bill whereby individual departments may, where necessary, specify format and procedural requirements for the submission of electronic information under a rule of law.\n", "\nCertification Authorities\n", "\nTo provide a secure and trusted environment for the conduct of electronic transactions, Government will establish a local public key infrastructure through the support of certification authorities.\n", "\nWith the issue of digital certificates by certification authorities and through the use of digital signatures and public/private key encryption, individuals and businesses will be able to establish the identity of the opposite party in electronic transactions, authenticate electronic messages received, ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of electronic messages exchanged will not be breached and safeguard against the repudiation of electronic transactions.\n", "\nVoluntary Recognition Scheme\n", "\nWe do not propose to introduce a mandatory licensing scheme for the regulation of certification authorities so as to encourage the development of certification authorities to meet the needs of the market.\n", "\nHowever, to protect consumer interest, we propose to introduce a voluntary system of recognition whereby certification authorities are free to apply for recognition from Government.\n", "\n. The Director of Information Technology Services will be the authority for granting Government recognition to certification authorities under the Bill.\n", "\nCertification authorities applying for recognition must achieve a trust standard in their operation which is acceptable to Government and adopt a common and open interface to ensure inter-operability with other recognised certification authorities under the local public key infrastructure before Government recognition will be granted.\n", "\nThe Bill further stipulates that certification authorities must comply with the following requirements -\n", "\n(a) publication of a certification practice statement which clearly specifies the practices and standards adopted for issuing certificates to subscribers;\n", "\n(b) use of a trustworthy technical system in performing certification authority services;\n", "\n(c) engagement of an approved professional to conduct an annual audit on the provision of certification authority services; and\n", "\n(d) compliance with a code of practice issued by Government.\n", "\nIf we detect any failure to comply with these requirements by a recognised certification authority, we may suspend temporarily or revoke the recognition granted.\n", "\nWe believe that, through the operation of the voluntary recognition system, we can facilitate the development of certification authorities in Hong Kong.\n", "\nConsumers will also be able to assess the trust standard of individual certification authorities and to make an informed choice when obtaining certification authority services.\n", "\nTo encourage certification authorities to seek Government recognition under the proposed voluntary regime, we have stipulated in the Bill that the provision therein regarding legal recognition of digital signatures applies only to those digital signatures supported by recognised certificates issued by certification authorities which are recognised by Government.\n", "\nIn addition, we have, in line with common practice adopted elsewhere, introduced a provision to allow recognised certification authorities to limit their liability in the issue of recognised certificates under prescribed situations.\n", "\nThe limitation applies only when the recognised certification authority concerned has complied with the various requirements under the Bill, and has not acted negligently, intentionally or recklessly.\n", "\nWe consider these measures crucial in encouraging the development of a public key infrasturcture and the establishment of certification authorities in Hong Kong.\n", "\nCertification authorities which have not obtained recognition from Government are outside the application of the Bill.\n", "\nThey will rely on common law principles in providing certification authority services to their subscribers.\n", "\nIn order to establish a public key infrastructure in Hong Kong as soon as possible, Government will take the lead in establishing a public certification authority through the Hongkong Post, which will start to provide public certification services to the local public and businesses on a non-exclusive basis by the end of 1999.\n", "\nThe early approval of this Bill will facilitate the promotion of public certification services.\n", "\nIn addition to the Hongkong Post, the private sector is free to set up certification authorities in Hong Kong to serve the needs of the community.\n", "\nThe number of certification authorities to be established in Hong Kong will be determined entirely by market force.\n", "\nConclusion\n", "\nMadam President, the Electronic Transactions Bill will lay the foundation for the development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong.\n", "\nTo enable Hong Kong to take the stride forward, to cope with the development in the new era and to maintain our competitiveness in the new Information Age, I wish to appeal to Members that the Bill should be examined at the earliest opportunity.\n", "\nI also

Age.\n", "\nIn the information world of today, there are few areas of our everyday life which are not touched by information technology in one form or another.\n", "\nA prominent feature of the Information World is the phenomenal growth of the Internet.\n", "\nBy exploiting the convergence of computing power, telecommunications and multi-media presentation, the Internet has created an ever expanding and digitally connected virtual community - a community which transcends geographical and time boundaries.\n", "\nThis ever-expanding virtual community is not only a vast source of information and resources; it also provides new and enormous business opportunities.\n", "\nTo put in perspective the astonishing speed at which the Internet and the globally connected virtual community have developed, I should perhaps cite some statistics here.\n", "\nIt took 38 years for the radio to reach an audience of 50 million people globally, and 13 years for television.\n", "\nBut it took the Internet only four years to cross that threshold.\n", "\nThe number of Internet users worldwide has now exceeded 100 million and is growing by the minute.\n", "\nTraffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days.\n", "\nAnd the volume of transactions over the Internet has been surging too.\n", "\nRecent industry estimates suggest that global purchases through the Internet will increase to US$220 billion by 2001.\n", "\nThe potential market for electronic commerce that one can tap in cyberspace is thus enormous.\n", "\nExperience in the US has shown that electronic commerce is transforming the way that business is operated.\n", "\nThere are some key issues which I would like to highlight.\n", "\nFirst, development of new markets.\n", "\nThe Internet knows no geographical boundaries or time zones.\n", "\nThrough electronic commerce conducted over the Internet, we can reach new markets which may be too costly to explore through conventional means.\n", "\nThis is particularly useful to small and medium sized enterprises which cannot afford the cost of establishing physical presence overseas to tap these markets.\n", "\nSecond, reduction of sales and marketing costs.\n", "\nThere are many constraints for businesses to physically expand their sales force in order to cope with market demands.\n", "\nHowever, with electronic commerce, expansion of sales activities would require minimum additional cost and effort as the expansion could often be achieved by simply expanding the capacity of the network servers.\n", "\nThis is of course much cheaper and more flexible than the employment of additional sales personnel.\n", "\nThird, reduction in inventory.\n", "\nThrough closer and more direct contact with both customers and suppliers via the Internet, we can trim down unproductive inventory, shorten production cycle and reduce throughput time.\n", "\nFourth, better customer relationship.\n", "\nBy putting information on product description, support services or order status online, we will be able to provide more efficient and effective services to our customers.\n", "\nThe services can also be individually customised to build up customer loyalty in an increasingly competitive world.\n", "\nThe points I have just set out should have made it crystal clear that Hong Kong has to embrace electronic commerce in order to stay competitive in the information world.\n", "\nThe HKSAR Government fully recognises the importance of electronic commerce in driving our future growth.\n", "\nWe are firmly committed to promoting the development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong, especially amongst the small and medium sized enterprises, which make up over 95% of our businesses.\n", "\nIt is our aim to provide a favourable environment for electronic commerce to take hold and flourish in Hong Kong.\n", "\nLet me take this opportunity to outline Government initiatives in this important area.\n", "\nFirst, we will take an active part in demonstrating to the community the benefits of electronic commerce by becoming a leading user.\n", "\nWe will launch the Electronic Service Delivery scheme - a scheme to provide Government services over the Internet.\n", "\nOur aim is not only to provide more efficient and better quality public services to the community, but also to encourage the community to accept electronic commerce as an integral part of daily living.\n", "\nBy raising general awareness in, and acceptance, of electronic business, the ESD scheme will also act as a catalyst to pump-prime the development of electronic commerce in the private sector.\n", "\nWe will establish an open and common information infrastructure accessible throughout the territory for our ESD scheme.\n", "\nAt a later stage, we intend to open up the infrastructure for the conduct of electronic commerce by the private sector.\n", "\nWe have invited tender for the supply of the Electronic Service Delivery system.\n", "\nThe tender exercise will close on 9 April.\n", "\nWe expect to have the first phase of the scheme up and running in the latter half of next year.\n", "\nPhase I will cover the services of ten departments and public agencies.\n", "\nSecond, we will provide a safe and secure environment for the conduct of electronic commerce through the establishment of a local public key infrastructure and the public certification authorities.\n", "\nWith the use of digital signatures using public/private key mechanism, we will be able to establish the identity of the parties to an electronic transaction, authenticate electronic messages, guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of the messages and ensure that they cannot be repudiated.\n", "\nGovernment will take the lead through the Hongkong Post.\n", "\nThe department has just invited tenders for the supply of the system and services for the establishment of a local public certification service.\n", "\nThe tender exercise will close on 5 March.\n", "\nThe service should be up and running by the end of this year.\n", "\nThird, we will develop a clear legal framework to provide certainty in the conduct of electronic transactions.\n", "\nWe will give the same legal recognition to electronic records and digital signatures as that for their paper-based counterparts.\n", "\nWe are now working on a bill to establish the legal framework, and we aim to introduce the bill into the Legislative Council within the next quarter.\n", "\nFourth, we will launch a series of publicity and promotion activities to encourage the business community to adopt electronic commerce.\n", "\nMy speaking to you this afternoon is part of our efforts in that area.\n", "\nFifth, we will try to nurture the growth of our IT industry as a strong IT industry is essential to the development of applications for electronic commerce.\n", "\nA key element in our strategy is to outsource Government IT projects as much as practicable.\n", "\nIn 1998-99, Government spending on IT is expected to reach HK$2.1 billion, an 11 % increase over the last financial year.\n", "\nDespite the current economic downturn, we will continue to push vigorously the use of IT within Government, both to improve services and to enhance productivity.\n", "\nStarting from next financial year, all new IT development and maintenance projects will, as a preference, be outsourced unless there are over-riding reasons for retaining the work in-house.\n", "\nOur target is to outsource two-thirds of all new IT projects in Government by 2001 so as to create a market of

"\nFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon David Li and a written reply by the Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands, Mr Gordon Siu, in the Legislative Council today (Wednesday):\n", "\nQuestion:\n", "\nIt is observed that the air pollution problem last winter was acute.\n", "\nIn this connection, will the Government inform this Council of the actions it will take to alleviate the air pollution problem in the coming winter?\n", "\nReply:\n", "\nMadam President,\n", "\nWe face two air pollution problems.\n", "\nFirst, street level air pollution mainly caused by the intensity of vehicle use in our dense urban environment.\n", "\nSecond, visible ambient air pollution caused by emission sources in Hong Kong but is also affected by regional air quality problems.\n", "\nIn respect of the second problem, emissions from Hong Kong and from Southern China each affect the other's background air pollution.\n", "\nThe influence of the cross boundary effects in Hong Kong is most noticeable during the winter months when the prevailing winds come northerly directions.\n", "\nThis is generally the time when we record the highest levels of air pollution and poorest visibility.\n", "\nIn respect of the street level air pollution problem, a series of measures to reduce the emissions of the present vehicle fleet, in particular from diesel vehicles, are being taken.\n", "\nThese include:\n", "\n(1) New diesel vehicles: All new diesel vehicles having to meet much tighter specifications than the old diesel vehicles they replace.\n", "\nVehicles meeting the latest standards emit 80 per cent less particulates and 53 per cent less hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides than pre-1995 vehicles.\n", "\nOne significant measure for improving urban air quality is the replacement of ex-CMB buses.\n", "\nThe latest planning is that 500 ex-CMB buses will be replaced by end of 1999.\n", "\n(2) Taxis: we are working to ensure that all taxis will switch from diesel fuel to LPG from end 2000.\n", "\nIn the interim, we are working with the trade to improve the standards of maintenance and to develop particulate traps that can reduce the particulate emissions by up to 20 per cent from individual diesel taxis before they convert to the cleaner LPG.\n", "\n(3) Buses: the franchised bus companies have agreed to install diesel catalysts on some 2,000 buses that do not meet the latest Euro II emission standards.\n", "\nThese can reduce emissions from individual vehicles by up to 50 per cent.\n", "\nAt the same time, the Transport Department is carrying out a major exercise to reduce the number of bus stops so as to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and thereby reduce emissions.\n", "\n(4) Pedestrianisation: an action group has been set up to identify areas of the city that are badly affected by street level air pollution, and could benefit from pedestrianisation or restricted access schemes.\n", "\nWe will work together with the District Boards and local communities to turn these ideas into practical schemes to reduce the exposure of citizens to street level pollution.\n", "\n(5) Light diesel vehicles: we are working with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to develop particulate traps similar to those being developed for taxis for all categories of light diesel vehicles.\n", "\n(6) Heavy diesel vehicles: we will conduct a trial using suitable vehicles in the Government fleet and the private sector to test out catalysts that can be used by different types of heavy vehicles.\n", "\nSubject to the findings of the trial, we would consider whether all suitable government heavy vehicles should be fitted with catalysts and encourage private transport operators to do the same.\n", "\n(7) Cleaner fuel: we have banned leaded petrol and required the most stringent motor diesel fuel in Asia.\n", "\nWe are working to introduce ultra low sulphur diesel fuel initially for franchised bus fleet.\n", "\nWe will also be exploring with the industrial sector to improve the standard for industrial diesel to match present standard for motor diesel.\n", "\n(8) Education: major education efforts targeted at professional drivers and at the motor vehicle maintenance trade are being launched.\n", "\nWe are also launching new programmes to educate every section of the community about what they can do to help tackle air pollution.\n", "\n(9) Enforcement: the Police and the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) are stepping up action against smoky vehicles.\n", "\nEPD is going to expand its smoky vehicle spotter scheme and the Customs and Excise Department is increasing enforcement against vehicles using illegal motor fuel and against suppliers of illegal fuel.\n", "\n(10) New testing equipment: the Police have already been provided with portable smoke meter for more effective on-street enforcement against smoky vehicles.\n", "\nSmoky vehicle testing centres for light duty vehicles will have new dynamometer testing equipment in September.\n", "\nHeavy vehicle dynamometers will be introduced in 2000.\n", "\n(11) Legislation: we will put to the Legislative Council within this year a proposal to increase the level of fixed penalty fine for smoky vehicle offences.\n", "\nWe will also set out for public consultation later this year scheme to control over idling vehicles which fail to switch off their engines.\n", "\n(12) Government taking the lead: a series of measures are being adopted to improve the environmental performance of the government vehicle fleet.\n", "\nWe will review the use of the fleet to ensure optimal use of existing vehicles.\n", "\nAbout 1,000 pre Euro I diesel vehicles will be replaced with Euro II or higher standard vehicles within three years.\n", "\nWe will include environmental performance of vehicles as one of the assessment criteria for hired car contracts.\n", "\nGovernment fleet will be used to test out new technology vehicles.\n", "\nThese measures to contain street level emissions also will have effect on ambient air quality and visibility, but the extent of this effect depends upon other measures being taken to tackle local and regional air pollution.\n", "\nWithin Hong Kong, emissions from power generation, industry and construction have all reduced significantly.\n", "\nSulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions fell by 54 per cent and 45 per cent respectively between 1992 and 1997.\n", "\nHowever, the continuing development and urbanization of Hong Kong and Guangdong is putting pressure on air quality in the entire Pearl River Delta Region.\n", "\nRapidly increasing air pollution emissions from sources such as motor vehicles, power stations, industries and construction activities are having serious adverse impact on both
