Since 1996 Norway has buried nearly 70 million tons of compressed carbon below the North Sea where it had extracted fuels. In each case the CO2, after being captured by solvents, would be pumped into geologic formations which were thought to be safe storage areas. As efficient technology to compress, transport and store the carbon is developed it could be provided to developing countries such as China and India offering help in the fight against global warming.

In November the U.S. Department of Energy revealed than an experimental project with sequestration in a live oil field brought more oil to the surface. In 2006 plans were announced for similar projects in Britain and Norway with a Norwegian expert saying their project could increase oil recovery by at least 155 million barrels in its lifetime.

In Texas, scientists are burying tons of compressed carbon dioxide beneath an old oil field. Norway has buried tons below North Sea oilfields. The energy industry now injects compressed CO2 into the ground to make it easier to get oil out of the ground.

Carbon sequestration is not new; petroleum producers have pumped compressed CO2 into oil-bearing structures to force oil to the surface for years. Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea. Carbon dioxide from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is pumped 185 miles to a working oilfield in Canada. In 2004 scientists planned to sequester carbon in deep sandstone deposits. Coal gasification is necessary for sequestration.

The US Department of Energy estimates that one-third to one-half of the emissions released into the atmosphere could be eliminated by this methodology.

Recent studies have demonstrated that disorders like schizophrenia have a genetic basis. Evidence that children from malnourished women are more likely to develop schizophrenia supports the theory that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic predisposition influenced by environmental triggers. Researchers found that levels of a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA were abnormal in schizophrenics and linked to a miswired network. For decades scientists linked schizophrenic symptoms to abnormalities in the brain chemical dopamine. Studies later identified genes that make people susceptible to schizophrenia.

Scientists knew that vitamin A plays an important role in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; now they've discovered it acts upon a gene that influences neuron activity. Damage to the enzyme PDE4B increases the risk of developing mental illness, and researchers have discovered that the gene DISC1 acts as a regulator for PDE4B.

The long-standing belief in problems of childhood as a cause has been largely discarded, but environmental factors are still seen as playing a role. Famine, malnutrition, or infection of a pregnant woman may cause changes in a developing fetal brain and heavy smoking of marijuana by teenagers may trigger a genetic predisposition.

Leung Yiu-chung, the Hon. David Li, and the Hon. Mrs. Sophie Leung prompted replies from the Secretary for the Environment and Food and the Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands.  These inquiries primarily focused on the actions the Government will take in the future to alleviate the air pollution problem.  Another focus of the questioning was an obvious source of the problem; vehicle emissions.\n\nIn reply to these inquiries, the Legislative Council cited the tightening of emission standards and the use of alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, emphasizing their commitment to the common goal.\n", "Several dialogues between the Legislative Council and various secretaries including Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands, Secretary for the Environment and Food, Secretary for Health and Welfare; as well as statements made to the press by the Government Land Trasport Agency (GLTA) seek to promote the image of a government that considers environmental protection a top priority.\n\nAccording to the various Secretaries, there are a wide range of on-going and new measures aimed at reducing the amount of air-pollution caused by automobiles. Several of these measures include: switching taxi and bus service from diesel machines to less-polluting Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) vehicles; providing education and incentives for drivers and government fleet managers to raise their environmental protection awareness and maintain adequate maitenence of their vehicles; reducing the polluting content of some fuels, such as the benzene in petrol; increasing ease and availability of public transportation, and promoting pedestrianisation in order to reduce the number of automobiles; implementing more stringent and practical vehicle emmision standards, including Euro III emission standards for all new diesel vehicles, as well as providing free installation of catalytic converters capable of reducing particulates emmissions in pre-Euro standard medium and heavy diesel vehicles by up to 50%.\n\n", "The Hong Kong government is taking several measures to improve air quality in the region.  Among the areas of concern are helping vehicles switch to more efficient fuels, monitoring levels of industrial pollution, and providing civic education on pollution problems.\n\nThe government is planning to offer grants to owners of taxis and light buses to switch to more efficient LPG fuel. For light diesel vehicles, and in the short term for taxis and light buses, particulate traps to reduce emissions will be installed free of charge.  As for buses and more heavy diesel vehicles, the government plans to arrange free installation of catalytic converters. Diesel vehicles releasing excessive smoke will be monitored.\n\nFor industrial sources of emission, natural gas has been introduced for power generation in Hong Kong, and coal plants have been required to reduce harmful emissions.  The government has also introuduced licensing control on major industrial sources of pollution.\n\nEducation is being provided to vehicle service professionals on measures to reduce emsissions.  The Environmental Protection Department also holds seminars and exhibitions to educate the public on air pollution.  Through the measures it is taking and plans to take, the government hopes to improve air quality in Hong Kong.\n\t\n"]}, "Group_881": {"100": ["Customs officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau are busy combating piracy activities and preserving the good image of Hong Kong.\nCustoms conducts intensive investigations on the retail front and protecting control points at the borders of Hong Kong from smugglers.\nPirated optical discs are often VCDs, CD-Roms, music CDs, and MCDs, and sometimes the VCDs are obscene.

This decision was finalized on January 29, 1999 by the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  The CFA also ruled that these persons could enter Hong Kong for settlement without the approval of the Mainland authorities.\n\nSeveral different people gave speeches that addressed decision of the CFA including the Secretaries for Security, Mrs. Regina Ip and Mr. Peter Lai, Secretary for Justice and Ms. Elsie Leung.  Ms. Leung gave speeches at the International Bar Association Conference on the worldwide application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a Symposium on  \"The Implementation and Prospects of 'One Country, Two Systems'\" in Commemoration of the 9th Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Basic Law and at the Credit Suisse first Boston Asian Investment Conference.\n\nOther important court decisions include Immigration (Amendment)(No.5) Bill 1997.\n\n\n\n", "The judgments of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) delivered on 29 January 1999 have extended the eligibility for the right of abode (ROA) of persons born in the Mainland of Hong Kong permanent residents beyond that previously provided for in the Immigration Ordinance. The CFA also ruled that these persons could enter Hong Kong for settlement without the approval of the Mainland authorities. In its judgments, the CFA decided that certain provisions in two previous ROA Ordinances were inconsistent with the Basic Law. These rulings place a great deal of pressure on HKSAR: previously, the number of people that would be eligible would have been about 200,000, but with the ruling, this increases to over a million people. The ROA issue is the most serious question HKSAR has ever encountered since its establishment. The ROA issue is also the most important and fundamental issue of Hong Kong society, for it relates to the people's fundamental rights and to the number of people eligible for becoming permanent residents. To reprehend the situation, a motion has been made to appeal to the NPCSC for an interpretation of Basic Law and to find a resolution.\n"]}, "D0727G": {"D0727.M.250.G.A": ["On July 29, 1999 Newt
