packets.", " THE CURRENT FIX: Internet applications such as firewalls and spam filters attempt to control security threats.", "But because such techniques do not penetrate deep into the network, bad data still get passed along, clogging systems and possibly fooling the filtering technology.", " THE CLEAN-SLATE SOLUTION: The network would have to be redesigned to be skeptical of all users and data packets from the start.", "Data would not be passed along unless the packets are authenticated.", "Faster computers today should be able to handle the additional processing required within the network.", " MOBILITY", " THE CHALLENGE: Computers rarely moved, so numeric Internet addresses were assigned to devices based on their location.", "A laptop, on the other hand, is constantly on the move.", " THE CURRENT FIX: A laptop changes its address and reconnects as it moves from one wireless access point to another, disrupting data flow.", "Another workaround is to have all traffic channel back to the first access point as a laptop moves to a second or a third location, but delays could result from the extra distance.", " THE CLEAN-SLATE SOLUTION: The address system would have to be

CHALLENGE: The Internet was designed when there were relatively few computers connecting to it.", "The proliferation of personal computers and mobile devices led to a scarcity in the initial address system.", "There will be even more demand for addresses as toasters, air conditioners and other devices come with Internet capability, as will standalone sensors for measuring everything from the temperature to the availability of parking spaces.", " THE CURRENT FIX: Engineers expanded the address pool with a system called IPv6, but nearly a decade after most of the groundwork was completed, the vast majority of software and hardware still use the older, more crowded IPv4 technology.", "Even if more migrate to IPv6, processing the addresses for all the sensors could prove taxing.", " THE
