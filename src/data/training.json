The Food and Drug\nAdministration published a report on its Web site on Tuesday by a\nstaff researcher, concluding that more than 27,000 deaths could be\nattributed to Vioxx based on comparisons with how patients taking\nother painkillers had fared.\n", "\nOn Thursday, the Lancet, a respected British medical journal,\npublished an analysis of all the clinical trials of Vioxx completed\nby 2001, and concluded that Merck and the FDA should have known\nenough about the drug's hazards to withdraw it years ago.\n", "\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers plan to compare notes next week on the types\nof clients who may make the strongest cases, with a premium on people\nwho were in demonstrably good health before taking Vioxx.\n", "\nThe group also intends to discuss ways to cooperate in gathering\nevidence and expert testimony, and in devising tactics to influence\nwhere the bulk of the cases may end up, as state and federal judges\nconsolidate them. Until such matters are resolved, how soon any of\nthe cases may come to trial is uncertain, including one that had been\nexpected to begin as early as next month in federal court in\nBirmingham, Ala.\n", "\nMany lawyers will also be jockeying for roles that will maximize\ntheir influence, and ultimately their reimbursement, as the\nlitigation unfolds.\n", "\nMore than 20 million Americans have used Vioxx since it went on the\nmarket in 1999. Millions more used the drug overseas. Based on the\nnumber of Vioxx customers and the seriousness of the injuries, the\nVioxx lawsuits would appear to have the potential to dwarf recent\ncases like the one against Baycol, a cholesterol-lowering drug used\nby about 700,000 Americans, and the one against the diet supplement\nfen-phen, which an estimated 6 million people took.\n", "\nBaycol's maker, the Bayer Group of Germany, said in late September\nthat it had paid $1.09 billion to settle 2,861 lawsuits and that\n7,577 suits were pending. And Wyeth, the marketer of fen-phen, faces\ncontinuing legal battles with plaintiffs who opted out of a\nsettlement program that pays victims from a $3.75 billion trust fund.\nWyeth has set aside $16.6 billion to cover its liabilities.\n", "\nMany plaintiffs' lawyers say it is too early to make a realistic\nassessment of Merck's financial vulnerability. Merck, the nation's\nsecond-largest drugmaker, has long been among the nation's strongest\ncompanies financially, with a credit rating among the highest in\nAmerican business.\n", "\nIn their meetings next week, the lawyers are likely to weigh the\npotential impact of this week's national elections, which\nstrengthened the Republican-led effort to curb product liability\nlawsuits. A related concern for the plaintiffs' lawyers is the FDA's\ncontinuing efforts under the Bush administration to persuade judges\nthat FDA approval of a drug, along with warnings on the label, should\ngo a long way toward shielding the maker from lawsuits.\n", "\nSo far, most state judges have rejected the FDA immunity argument.\nBut if courts began to accept it -- or Congress made it the law of\nthe land -- plaintiffs' lawyers would have the higher hurdle of\narguing that Merck deceived the FDA by hiding or distorting damaging\ndata. That case would be hard to make without supportive testimony\nfrom the agency, some lawyers said.\n", "\nThe personal injury lawsuits -- or tort cases, as lawyers call them\n-- can be filed in state or federal courts and in many cases name\nother parties, like doctors or drug distributor, as co-defendants\nwith Merck.\n", "\nIn the hundreds of Vioxx lawsuits filed before Merck took the drug\noff the market, the action was primarily in New Jersey, where Merck\nis based, and the big states of Texas and California. But the\nfinancial burden of taking on a giant like Merck while it continued\nto insist that Vioxx was safe and effective scared away many lawyers.\n", "\n\"It's been a quiet little mass tort for a long time,\" said Carlene\nRhodes Lewis, a Houston lawyer whose firm was among the pioneers when\nit began filing Vioxx complaints in 2001. Lewis and her partners took\non nearly 300 such cases by the time Merck pulled the plug on Vioxx.\n", "\nMerck's withdrawal of Vioxx has made it much easier for lawyers to\nargue to a jury that the product should not have been on the market.\nBut proving liability could still be difficult.\n", "\nThe data from clinical studies suggest, so far, that the most serious\nhealth problems hit patients who had used Vioxx for 18 months or\nlonger. Merck has said it does not know yet how large that group is.\n", "\nIn addition, many possible Vioxx victims may find it difficult to pin\ntheir health problems on the drug if forced to go to trial, lawyers\nwho filed the early cases said. The injuries linked to Vioxx are also\ncommon among people who have not used the drug, and they have many\ncauses.\n", "\n\"The person who should never have taken Vioxx and should have been\nwarned by Merck, the person with multiple risks of cardiac problems,\nmay not make the best client, because it may be harder to prove that\nVioxx caused the heart attack,\" said Cynthia Anne Solomon, a lawyer\nin Mt. Pleasant, S.C.\n", "\nAs a result, the pioneering plaintiffs' lawyers in the Vioxx\nlitigation have been carefully screening potential clients in search\nof those who were relatively healthy before they took the drug and\nsuffered injuries. Some of those lawyers said they were worried that\nlawyers who rushed into the field after Merck withdrew the drug,\nincluding law firms soliciting clients with radio and print\nadvertising, will muddy the legal landscape with questionable claims.\n", "\n\"For every hundred calls we get, there are only two or three top-end\ncases,\" Papantonio said.\n", "\nHe and others said that Merck, if it follows the course of other drug\ncompanies in similar situations, is likely to try to settle the\nstrongest cases against it and fight some of the weaker claims in\ntrials. If it wins those trials, it could knock down the settlement\nvalue of the vast majority of claims against it and cut billions of\ndollars from its potential exposure.\n", "\nMerck recently asked the panel of judges that supervises the way mass\ntorts are handled in federal courts to assign all of the lawsuits to\none judge. Becnel filed a similar petition.\n", "\nThe panel is expected to hear arguments on the petitions and where\nthe cases should be consolidated at its January meeting.\n", "\nMany lawyers involved in the lawsuits say the federal consolidation\nprocess should hasten final settlement of most of the Vioxx cases.\nThe state cases in New Jersey and California have already gone\nthrough such a process.\n", "\nBut the effort to centralize the federal cases while sorting out\nwhich cases will remain in state courts -- where plaintiffs' lawyers\nusually prefer them -- could very likely lead to procedure battles\nthat may delay the first Vioxx trials. Several were on course to\nbegin in the next few months.\n", "\n\"It's up in air now,\" said Andy D.

I came to realize,'' Friedan later wrote, ``that something\nis very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their\nlives today. . . .For the startling pattern that began to emerge as\none clue led me to another in far-flung fields of modern thought and\nlife, defied not only the conventional image but basic psychological\nassumptions about women.''\n", "\nShe found that books on the psychology of women generally adhered\nto traditional ideas of women's fulfillment in hearth and home.\nSeeking a theoretical basis for her views of women's plight, Friedan\nturned to the work on identity and self realization by psychologists\nincluding Abraham Maslow and Erik Erikson. Their ideas informed what\nbecame her central tenet: ``that the core of the problem for women\ntoday is . . . a problem of identity -- a stunting or evasion of\ngrowth that is perpetuated by the feminine mystique.''\n", "\nFriedan finally produced a 1,000-page manuscript. It took her five\nyears.\n", "\nFriedan's publisher, W. W. Norton, printed only a few thousand\nhardcover copies in 1963. Friedan did not experience the full force of\nfame until Dell issued the paperback in 1964. That year, ``The\nFeminine Mystique'' became the top-selling nonfiction book in the\ncountry. Much of the initial reaction was not favorable. Friedan was\ncursed, told to seek psychiatric help and accused of posing ``more of\na threat to the United States than the Russians.'' She was shunned by\nneighborhood women, her children were kicked out of car pools, and her\nmarriage began to crack under the weight of her growing celebrity.\n", "\nTo many black women more concerned with survival than\nself-fulfillment, Friedan's call to women to find meaningful careers\n``seemed to come from another planet,'' according to historian Paula\nGiddings.\n", "\nThe personal narrative that gave ``Feminine Mystique'' much of its\npower was misleading in another way: It omitted references to\nFriedan's earlier career as a left-wing journalist, creating the\nimpression that the author had never been anything other than a\nsuburban matron.\n", "\nYears later, biographer Daniel Horowitz would accuse Friedan of\nobscuring her past to sell books. But Friedan insisted she was only\nbeing politically savvy. ``It was the McCarthy era . . . and I didn't\ngo around parading my left-wing background because it wouldn't have\nhelped in organizing the women's movement,'' she told the Los Angeles\nTimes a few years ago. ``On the other hand, I never kept it secret.''\n", "\n``The Feminine Mystique'' was so astute in its analysis that, as\nfuturist Alvin Toffler said, it ``pulled the trigger on history.'' The\nbook launched a tumultuous decade for American women, with Friedan at\nthe epicenter.\n", "\nIn June 1966, Friedan joined members of state commissions on the\nstatus of women for a national conference in Washington, D.C. Four\nmonths later, they reconvened and Friedan was elected president of the\nnascent National Organization for Women.\n", "\nAmong its signature success was lobbying President Lyndon Johnson\nto sign an Executive Order prohibiting sex discrimination by federal\ncontractors.\n", "\nToday, the group is anchored in Washington, D.C., and has 500,000\nmembers and branches in all 50 states. But in its early years, NOW's\nheadquarters was Friedan's New York City apartment and Friedan was\nindisputably in charge.\n", "\nIn 1970, the largest feminist demonstration since the suffrage\nmovement took over Fifth Avenue when Friedan called for a national\nWomen's Strike for Equality. Held on the 50th anniversary of the\npassage of the women's suffrage amendment, it drew 500,000 women.\n", "\nBut during these heady years, Friedan's marriage was crumbling. She\nclaimed years later to have been a battered wife, a contention that\noutraged Carl Friedan, who vociferously denied the charges. Their\n22-year marriage ended in divorce in 1969.\n", "\nIn 1970, Friedan would step down as NOW president amid growing\ndissatisfaction with her vision of the movement. But not even her\ncritics could deny the power of the changes she had unleashed.\n", "\nBy this time the mother of the movement was being assaulted by its\nmore radical elements. In 1969 she had delivered her first public\nattack on lesbianism, labeling it a ``lavender menace'' that would\ntarnish the entire feminist agenda. Enraged, many lesbians quit NOW.\n", "\nBy the end of the 1970s, Friedan was relegated to the sidelines of\nthe movement she had inspired. She was dismayed not only by its\ndirection but what she saw as its mounting toll and the growing\npolitical backlash. As she saw it, the movement had burdened rather\nthan liberated women, burning out those who were trying to juggle\nmotherhood and career or penetrate the corporate glass ceiling.\nMoreover, she observed, women in lower-level jobs were still earning\nonly 59 cents to every dollar earned by men -- this after almost two\ndecades of renewed feminist activism.\n", "\nFriedan's response was ``The Second Stage,'' published in 1981. The\nmovement's senior theorist always had insisted that men were not the\nenemy. In her new book, startlingly, she suggested that the enemy was\nthe victim herself.\n", "\n``I believe we have to break through our own feminist mystique,''\nFriedan wrote, arguing that, ``The equality we fought for isn't\nlivable, isn't workable, isn't comfortable in the terms that\nstructured our battle.'' Feminists, she charged, had fallen into a new\ntrap ``which denied that core of women's personhood that is fulfilled\nthrough love, nurture, home. . . .\n", "\nCalling the feminist foremother ''hopelessly confused about whose\nside she's on,`` theorist Ellen Willis wrote that Friedan ''would\ndestroy feminism in order to save it, and beat the Moral Majority by\njoining it.`` Journalist Susan Faludi, writing in her 1991 book\n''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women,`` said Friedan\nwas ''yanking out the stitches in her own handiwork.``\n", "\nFriedan began to turn her focus to other issues. She received a\ncall from the head of the National Institute on Aging, asking her to\nbecome an advocate for older Americans. She at first fought the idea,\n''locked in denial`` about the encroaching reality of her own aging --\nshe was approaching 60 and hating it. What changed her mind was\nremembering conversations she'd had with older women while researching\n''The Feminine Mystique.`` The healthiest and most vital women she\ninterviewed had been older women -- in their 50s and 60s -- who had\ncareers.\n", "\nIn 1993 she published ''The Fountain of Age,`` a book in which she\nagain challenged the prevailing stereotypes and argued that an active,\nengaged life was the secret to a good old age. The book earned mixed\nreviews, with some critics faulting her for presenting an overly\noptimistic view of the stage of life Friedan herself was experiencing.\n", "\n(End optional trim)\n", "\nIn her last years, Friedan split her time between homes in Sag\nHarbor, N.Y., and Washington, D.C. She spent more time with her\nchildren -- Daniel, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University who\nwon a MacArthur Foundation genius grant; Jonathan, an engineer in\nPhiladelphia; and Emily, a pediatrician in Buffalo, N.Y. -- and their\nfamilies.\n", "\nFriedan wrote six books and had teaching posts at many\ninstitutions, including Yale, Harvard, the University of California,\nLos Angeles and the University of Southern California. Surgery in 1997\nto replace an infected aortic valve slowed her down only a little. A\nfew years later, she was a distinguished visiting professor at Cornell\nUniversity, where she used a $1 million Ford Foundation grant to\nconduct a three-year study on women, men, work, family and public\npolicy.\n", "\nShe continued to deplore the lack of progress on issues that\naffected the quality of family life, such as flexible scheduling and\nbetter and more affordable child care.\n", "\nYet she seemed to look back on her life with immense pleasure,\nsaying that the women's movement had succeeded in the United States\nand other advanced countries beyond her wildest imaginings.\n", "\n''I thought once,`` she said, ''about what should be put on my\ngravestone: `She helped make women feel better about being women and\ntherefore better able to freely and fully love men.' ``\n"], "LTW_ENG_20050606.0060": ["\n", "\nI try very, very hard not to think of the conservative movement as\na gaggle of thick-skulled fanatics.

In 1974 the writer and\nactivist Robin Morgan had put it most starkly: \"Pornography is\nthe theory, rape is the practice.\"\n", "\nMacKinnon and Dworkin's antipornography statutes-which passed in Indianapolis and Bellingham, Wash.,\nand were defeated in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and Cambridge-made little\nuse of obscenity standards and instead reframed the issue as\none of sex discrimination. While their bills didn't ban porn\noutright, they allowed women to sue pornographers for damages.\n", "\nAnd those damages, the anti-porn feminists argued, weren't merely abstract. During\nthe debates over the local ordinances, and in testimony before\nEdwin Meese's Commission on Pornography in 1985, MacKinnon and others\narranged for often horrifying testimony by women on the physical\nand mental abuse they had suffered either in the making\nof pornography or at the hands of men they claimed\nhad been inspired by it. Some of the most dramatic\ntestimony was from Linda Lovelace, star of \"Deep Throat.\"\n", "\nSo what happened to those voices? Now a law professor at\nthe University of Michigan, MacKinnon has a new book out\nthis month, \"Women's Lives, Men's Laws\" (Belknap), which includes essays\nand speeches on pornography, but in recent years she and\nDworkin seem to have lost not just the legal battle\nbut the cultural war. These days, \"sex-positive\" feminists like Laura\nKipnis or Camille Paglia tend to get the airtime. And\nin the universities, women's studies scholars are more likely to\ndo close readings of the aesthetics and politics of pornography\nthan to march in favor of banning it.\n", "\nEven at the time, MacKinnon and Dworkin's campaign sharply split the\nfeminist movement. While supported by leading figures like Steinem and\nBrownmiller, the Indianapolis law in particular galvanized others in opposition.\nThey formed the Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce, or FACT. When the\nlaw's constitutionality was being decided by a federal appeals court,\nFACT submitted an amicus brief-signed by Betty Friedan, Rita Mae\nBrown, Kate Millet, Adrienne Rich and others-opposing it.\n", "\nTorn between the conflicting arguments, the National Organization of Women was\nunable to take a position. MacKinnon's description of her opponents,\nin a 1987 speech, was typical of the heated rhetoric:\n\"The Black movement has Uncle Toms and Oreo cookies. The\nlabor movement had scabs. The women's movement has FACT.\"\n", "\nStarting in the late 1980s some feminist scholars also began to\nsee porn as a tool that women could appropriate to\nliberate themselves from patriarchal norms of behavior and beauty. Porn\nsexuality, they argued, wasn't simply about subjugation. Instead, \"what pornography\nis trying to do is create, using real bodies, a\nfantasy of a kind of idealized and perfectly abundant pleasure,\"\nsays Linda Williams, a film studies professor at the University\nof California, Berkeley, and a leading porn theorist. What others\nmight see as basically a masturbatory aid was cast instead\nas a genre of utopian social criticism. As for the\nanti-porn crusaders, Williams adds: \"Really, who are they to tell\nus where our sexual imaginations should go?\"\n", "\nSo it was a deeply divided feminist movement that faced the\nfailure of MacKinnon and Dworkin's laws, not only in places\nlike Los Angeles and Cambridge, but when they were eventually\nstruck down by federal courts in both Indiana and Washington.\nAs Joshua Cohen, an MIT political science professor who has\nstudied the First Amendment ramifications of the laws, puts it,\n\"A lot of the energy that went into the issue\nduring the 1980s was focused on these legal strategies.\" When\nthey failed, he says, \"It became pretty clear that legal\nregulations directed to stop pornography were not going to be\naccepted by the courts, and that probably sapped some of\nthe energy from the anti-pornography movement.\"\n", "\nEven where they did survive, the laws had unintended and often\ncrudely ironic consequences. In Canada, which in 1992 adopted MacKinnon\nand Dworkin's definition of pornography, it was used largely to\nprosecute gay and lesbian bookstores and even to seize copies\nof two of Dworkin's books because they \"illegally eroticized pain\nand bondage.\"\n", "\nToday, Mackinnon bristles at the old charge that anti-porn feminists were,\nin effect, in bed with the political right. \"I actually\nknow who I'm in bed with,\" she said in a\nrecent interview. \"This was just something created by the pornographers\nto scare liberals off, which doesn't take much.\"\n", "\nBut her language has been adopted by some on the right.\nNow, according to Janet LaRue of Concerned Women for America,\n\"It may be that we're not hearing as much from\nthe traditional hardline feminist organizations, but when I write and\nspeak on the topic of pornography, one of the aspects\nthat I point out is that it certainly subjugates and\ndegrades women and reduces us to the sum or our\nbody parts.\"\n", "\nBut perhaps it's porn's very ubiquity that has most weakened the\nanti-pornography case, feminist and conservative. Thanks to the growth of\nhome-video pornography in the 1980s and the more recent shift\nto the Internet, far more people have access to X-rated\nmaterial than ever before. As Williams puts it, \"In a\nway I think MacKinnon and Dworkin were able to invoke\nthe kind of horror that they did at pornography at\na time when not as many people had seen it.\nFor better or for worse, now it has become part\nof the vernacular of our way of talking about picturing\nsex to ourselves.\"\n", "\nMacKinnon agrees, though she sees the shift as more insidious: \"The\ndata just show that pornography sets community standards, so the\nmore pornography there is, the less will be seen to\nbe wrong with it. It's just its own intrinsic dynamic.\"\n", "\nDespite the recent backlash against television indecency, pornography prosecutions remain rare.\nThe Bush administration has picked up the pace from the\nClinton administration, creating a special anti-porn unit in the Department\nof Justice and hiring Bruce Taylor, the prosecutor who went\nafter Larry Flynt in 1981, as its porn czar. Last\nmonth, the Justice Department announced that it would appeal a\nrecent decision by a federal judge that declared federal obscenity\nlaws unconstitutional. And speaking earlier this week, the new attorney\ngeneral, Alberto Gonzales, listed \"the aggressive prosecution of purveyors of\nobscene materials\" among his top priorities.\n", "\nStill, Frederick Schauer, a First Amendment scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School\nof Government, points out that \"criminal obscenity prosecutions have come\nclose to disappearing, they're constitutionally permissible but almost nonexistent.... The\nlegal definition of obscenity remains very, very, very narrow.\"\n", "\nAs for MacKinnon, since the early 1990s she has focused on\ninternational issues like prostitution, human trafficking, and war crimes. (In\n2000, she won a war crimes conviction against the Bosnian\nSerb leader Radovan Karadzic for the rape of Muslim and\nCroat women during the Bosnian War.) But she says pornography\nis still a central issue for her.\n", "\n\"Until a problem is solved, it's always a good time to\nsolve it,\" she says. \"Whether people want to solve it\nis another question.\"\n", "\nDrake Bennett is the staff writer for Ideas.

And the CIA says Khan sold\nnuclear materials to North Korea.\n", "\nAt a minimum, Khan provided a turn-key nuclear bomb program to\nLibya, while greatly speeding up the nuclear program of Iran,\na country that sponsors terrorist organizations.\n", "\n\"Iran wouldn't be talking about getting nuclear weapons if it hadn't\nbeen for Khan,\" said David Albright, a leading nuclear expert\nand president of the Institute for Science and International Security,\na non-proliferation think-tank.\n", "\nKhan's centrifuge designs are particularly important to covert nuclear programs because\nthey allow the development of bomb-making material with greater secrecy,\ncompared with the gaseous diffusion method of producing U-235.\n", "\n\"Centrifuge enrichment is much less energy-and-time consuming than gaseous diffusion, and\nyou can hide it a lot easier,\" said Henry Sokolski,\nexecutive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center in Washington,\nD.C.\n", "\nU.S. intelligence and the U.N.'s Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency are\ntrying to determine whether A.

Although they were subsequently\nreleased, the CIA now believes that one of the scientists\n\"may have provided some assistance to al-Qaida's program\" to acquire\nnuclear weaponry, the spy agency said in the recent report\nto Congress.\n", "\nBased on documents recovered in Afghanistan, the agency described al-Qaida's atomic\nefforts \"rudimentary nuclear research, although the extent of its indigenous\nprogram is unclear.\"\n", "\nInvestigators are also trying to determine the extent of the Khan\nnetwork and all of the companies around the globe that\nmay have played a part. There are at least 30\ncompanies in 30 countries \"all over the globe involved in\nthis fantastic, sophisticated, illicit trafficking network with Mr. A.Q. Khan\nacting as CEO,\" according to Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, chief of\nthe IAEA.\n", "\nMajor elements of Khan's network have been uncovered in Malaysia and\nSouth Africa. Malaysian police arrested a Sri Lankan businessman --\nBukhary Syed Abu Tahir -- who admitted shipping nuclear components\nto Iran and Libya at Khan's behest. Tahir also admitted\nreceiving two briefcases containing $3 million in cash from Iran\nin exchange for providing nuclear weapons material.\n", "\nIn South Africa, authorities are investigating the sale of nuclear weapons\ntechnology to Libya through middlemen tied to Khan. Three individuals\nallegedly tied to the Khan network, including European nationals, were\narrested as part of the South African investigation.\n", "\nKhan, the one person who could provide answers to the many\npending questions, is out of reach of the IAEA and\nU.S. intelligence agencies. Pakistan has refused to allow intelligence officers\nto talk to Khan, while offering to relay written questions\nto him. The problem with that arrangement is that investigators\ncan't be sure whether it's Khan -- or someone else\n-- answering the questions.\n", "\nNonetheless, a Vienna-based diplomat says the Pakistanis have been cooperative with\nU.S. and IAEA officials about disclosing what their investigators have\nuncovered concerning Khan's operations. Cooperation between Pakistani government and the\nU.S. and IAEA \"has moved slowly but positively,\" he said.\n", "\nThe IAEA wants to meet with Tahir, the Sri Lankan businessman\ncurrently in a Malaysian jail, to help officials frame better\nquestions to Khan, the diplomat said. In addition, the IAEA\nhas requested permission from Islamabad to send its investigators to\nexamine Pakistan's uranium centrifuges. By comparing the Pakistan models with\nthose in Iran, the IAEA can conclusively determine whether Iran's\ncentrifuges originated in Pakistan.\n", "\nGiven that the Pakistan military, headed by Gen.

Probably not,\" he\nsaid.\n", "\nOakley added that Khan's illicit export network wasn't a new creation\nbut rather reversed the flow of information and material on\nthe import network that Khan and the Pakistan military had\nused to acquire nuclear materials for their country's atomic program.\n", "\nThe assumption among some informed diplomats and intelligence officials is that,\nat a minimum, Khan must have had help from other\nsenior scientists in the Pakistani government.\n", "\n\"Khan is a metallurgist, so he understood well about building centrifuges,\"\na Vienna-based diplomat said. \"But he wouldn't necessarily understand bomb\ndesigns nor would he understand uranium conversion and the many\nother technologies involved.\"\n", "\nThe Bush administration, always working to build-up Musharraf, has accepted his\nclaims of innocence.\n", "\nSecretary of State Powell said that when he asked Musharraf if\nhe had known about Khan's work, the general denied any\nknowledge.\n", "\nKhan's nuclear network \"was so compartmented within government circles\" and Musharraf\nwas \"outside the circle,\" Powell said of Musharraf's explanation. \"That's\nwhat he has said to me, and I have no\nevidence to prove or disprove his statement.\"\n", "\nAll of which leads to the question of motive, another major\nthrust in the IAEA investigation. While Khan profited financially from\nthe sale of nuclear secrets, money likely was not the\nsole motivation.\n", "\nThe IAEA's ElBaradei has said that \"ideology\" also played a factor.\n", "\nFor example, Hassan Abbas, the former Pakistani security official, said Khan\nmay have been motivated by the strategic view held by\nsome Pakistani military leaders that spreading nuclear technology was a\nway to counter U.S. power and what Islamabad fears is\nan emerging alliance among India, the United States and Israel.\n", "\nWhile Khan is not a religious extremist like bin Laden, he\nmay also have been motivated by a pan-Muslim view of\nspreading weapons to guarantee the influence of Muslim countries.\n", "\n\"Khan was motivated by some element of ideology, greed and convoluted\nstrategic thinking,\" said Haqqani, the former Pakistani diplomat.\n", "\nAnother likely motivation is Khan's ample ego, said Oakley. \"It may\nbe a little of, 'Look at me.

As a result, much of the\nurgency has been sapped from the investigation, helping keep hidden\nthe full dimensions of the activities of Khan and his associates.\n", "\nThere is no shortage of tantalizing leads. U.S. intelligence\nofficials and the IAEA, working separately, are still untangling\nKhan's travels in the years before his arrest.

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n", "\nA POTENTIAL DANGER\n", "\nA.Q. Khan may have been unknown to most Americans when he was\nrevealed about a year ago as the mastermind of the largest illicit\nnuclear proliferation network in history. But for three decades Khan,\na metallurgist, has been well known to British and U.S. intelligence\nofficials. Even so, the United States and its allies passed up\nopportunities to stop him -- and apparently failed to detect that he\nhad begun selling nuclear technology to Iran in the late 1980s. It\nwas the opening transaction for an enterprise that eventually spread\nto North Korea, Libya and beyond.\n", "\nKhan studied in Pakistan and Europe. After he secured a job in the\nNetherlands in the early 1970s at a plant making centrifuges -- the\ndevices that purify uranium -- Dutch intelligence officials began\nwatching him. By late 1975, they grew so wary, after he was observed\nat a nuclear trade show in Switzerland asking suspicious questions,\nthat they moved him to a different area of the company to keep him\naway from uranium enrichment work.\n", "\n\"There was an awareness,\" said Frank Slijper of the Dutch Campaign\nagainst Arms Trade, who recently wrote a report on Khan's early days,\n\"that he was a potential danger.\"\n", "\nKhan suddenly left the country that December, called home by his\ngovernment for its atomic project. Years later, investigators\ndiscovered that he had taken blueprints for the centrifuges with him.\nIn Pakistan, Khan was working to develop a bomb to counter India's,\nand Washington was intent on stopping the project.\n", "\nIt later proved to be the first of several occasions when the United\nStates failed to fully understand what Khan was up to.\n", "\nJoseph Nye, a Harvard professor who has served in several\nadministrations, said U.S. intelligence agencies thought Pakistan\nwould try to make its bomb by producing plutonium -- an alternative\nbomb fuel. Nye was sent to France to halt the shipment of technology\nthat would have enabled Pakistan to complete a reprocessing plant for\nthe plutonium fuel. \"We returned to Washington to celebrate our\nvictory, only to discover that Khan had already stolen the technology\nfor another path to the bomb,\" Nye recalled.\n", "\nTo gather more atomic gear and skill, Khan returned to the\nNetherlands repeatedly. But the United States wanted to watch him,\nand a European diplomat with wide knowledge of nuclear intelligence\ncited the two occasions when the CIA persuaded the Dutch authorities\nnot to arrest him. Intelligence officials apparently felt Khan was\nmore valuable as an unwitting guide to the nuclear underworld.\n", "\n\"The Dutch wanted to arrest him,\" the diplomat said. \"But they were\ntold by the American CIA, 'Leave him so we can follow his trail.\"'\n", "\nA CHINESE CONNECTION\n", "\nKhan quickly led the agents to Beijing. It was there in the early\n1980s that Khan pulled off a coup: obtaining the blueprints for a\nweapon that China had detonated in its fourth nuclear test, in 1966.\nThe design was notable because it was compact and the first one China\nhad developed that could easily fit atop a missile.\n", "\nU.S. intelligence agencies only learned the full details of the\ntransactions earlier this year when the Libyans handed over two large\nplastic bags with the names of an Islamabad tailor on one side and a\ndry-cleaner on other -- one of several clues that it had come from\nthe Khan Laboratories. The design inside included drawings of more\nthan 100 parts, all fitting in a sphere about 34 inches in diameter,\njust the right size for a rocket.\n", "\nEqually remarkable were the handwritten notations in the margins.\n\"They made reference to Chinese ministers, presumably involved in the\ndeal,\" one official who reviewed it disclosed. And there was also a\nreference to \"Munir,\" apparently Munir Khan, Khan's rival who ran the\nPakistan Atomic Energy Commission and was in a contest with Khan to\nput together a Pakistani weapon that would match India's.\n", "\nIn that race, size was critical, because only a small weapon could be\nput atop Pakistani missiles. One note in the margin of the design,\nthe official said, was that \"Munir's bomb would be bigger.\"\n", "\nIntelligence experts believe that Khan traded his centrifuge\ntechnology to the Chinese for their bomb design.\n", "\nA certain familiarity developed between Khan and those watching him.\n", "\n\"I remember I was once in Beijing on a nonproliferation mission,\"\nsaid Robert J. Einhorn, a longtime proliferation official in the\nState Department, \"and we knew that Khan was in Beijing, too, and\nwhere he was. I had this fantasy of going over to his hotel, calling\nup to his room, and inviting him down for a cup of coffee.\"\n", "\nOf course, he never did. But if he had, Khan might not have been\nsurprised.\n", "\nSimon Henderson, a London-based author who has written about Khan for\nmore than two decades, said the Pakistani scientist long suspected he\nwas under close surveillance. \"Khan once told me, indignantly, 'The\nBritish try to recruit members of my team as spies,\"' Henderson\nrecalled. \"As far as I'm aware, he was penetrated for a long, long\ntime.\"\n", "\nStill, for all the surveillance, U.S. officials always seemed a step\nor two behind. In the 1990s, noted Einhorn, the assumption was that\nIran was getting most of its help from Russia, which was providing\nthe country with reactors and laser-isotope technology. Virtually no\nattention was paid to its contacts with Khan.\n", "\n\"It was a classic case of being focused in the wrong place,\" Einhorn\nsaid. \"And if Iran gets the bomb in the next few years, it won't be\nbecause of the Russians. It will be because of the help they got from\nA.Q. Khan.\"\n", "\nTRIUMPH AND MYSTERY\n", "\nAs soon as Bush came to office, his director of central intelligence,\nGeorge J. Tenet, began tutoring him on the dangers of Khan and\ndisclosing how deeply the agency believed it had penetrated his life\nand network. \"We were inside his residence, inside his facilities,\ninside his rooms,\" Tenet said in a recent speech. \"We were everywhere\nthese people were.\"\n", "\nBut acting on the Khan problem meant navigating the sensitivities of\na fragile ally important in the effort against terrorism. That has\nimpeded the inquiry ever since.\n", "\nWashington had little leverage to force Pakistan's president, Gen.\nPervez Musharraf, to clamp down on a national hero, especially since\nKhan may have had evidence implicating the Pakistani government in\nsome of the transactions. And in interviews, officials said they\nfeared that moving on Khan too early would hurt their chances to roll\nup the network.\n", "\nStephen J. Hadley, the deputy national security adviser, went to\nPakistan soon after the Sept. 11 attacks and raised concerns about\nKhan, some of whose scientists were said to have met with Osama bin\nLaden, al-Qaida's leader. But Hadley did not ask Musharraf to take\naction, according to a senior administration official. He returned to\nWashington complaining that it was unclear whether the Khan\nLaboratories were operating with the complicity of the Pakistani\nmilitary, or were controlled by freelancers, motivated by visions of\nprofit or of spreading the bomb to Islamic nations. The Pakistanis\ninsisted they had no evidence of any proliferation at all, a claim\nU.S. officials said they found laughable.\n", "\nAs evidence grew in 2003, Bush sent Tenet to New York to meet with\nMusharraf. \"We were afraid Khan's operation was entering a new, more\ndangerous phase,\" said one top official. Still there was little\naction.\n", "\nBut in late October 2003, the United States and its allies seized the\nBBC China, a freighter bearing centrifuge parts made in Malaysia,\nalong with other products of Khan's network, all bound for Libya.\nConfronted with the evidence, Libya finally agreed to surrender all\nof its nuclear program. Within weeks, tons of equipment was being\ndismantled and flown to the Energy Department's nuclear weapons lab\nat Oak Ridge, Tenn.\n", "\nPressures mounted on Musharraf. \"I said to him, 'We know so much\nabout this that we're going to go public with it,\"' Secretary of\nState Colin L. Powell told journalists last week. \"'And you need to\ndeal with this before you have to deal with it publicly.\"'\n", "\nOn television, Khan was forced to confess but he gave no specifics,\nand Musharraf pardoned the scientist. U.S. officials pressed to\ninterview him and his chief lieutenant, Tahir, a Sri Lankan\nbusinessman living in Dubai and Malaysia, who was eventually arrested\nby Malaysian authorities.\n", "\nBut the Pakistanis balked, insisting that they would pass questions\nto Khan and report back. Little information has been conveyed.\n", "\n\"Some questions simply were never answered,\" said one senior\nintelligence official. \"In other cases, you don't know if you were\ngetting Khan's answer, or the answer the government wanted you to\nhear.\"\n", "\nKhan's silence has extended to the question of what countries, other\nthan Libya, received the bomb design. Intelligence experts say they\nhave no evidence any other nation received the design, although they\nsuspect Iran and perhaps North Korea. But that search has been\nhampered by lack of hard intelligence.\n", "\n\"We strongly believe Iran did,\" said one U.S. official. \"But we need\nthe proof.\"\n", "\nKhan has also never discussed his ties with North Korea, a critical\nissue because the United States has alleged -- but cannot prove --\nthat North Korea has two nuclear arms programs, one using Khan\ntechnology.\n", "\n\"It is an unbelievable story, how this administration has given\nPakistan a pass on the single worst case of proliferation in the past\nhalf-century,\" said Jack Pritchard, who worked for President Clinton\nand served as the State Department's special envoy to North Korea\nuntil he quit last year, partly in protest over Bush's Korea policy.\n\"We've given them a pass because of Musharraf's agreement to fight\nterrorism, and now there is some suggestion that the hunt for Osama\nis waning. And what have we learned from Khan? Nothing.\"\n", "\nSOME MISSING PIECES\n", "\nIn March, U.S. investigators invited reporters to the giant nuclear\ncomplex in Oak Ridge to display the equipment disgorged by the\nLibyans. They surrounded the site with guards bearing automatic\nweapons, and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham joined the officials in\nshowing off some of the 4,000 centrifuges.\n", "\n\"We've had a huge success,\" he said.But it turned out that the\ncentrifuges were missing their rotors -- the high-speed internal\ndevice that makes them work. To this day, it is not clear where those\nparts were coming from. While some officials believe the Libyans were\ngoing to make their own, others fear the equipment had been shipped\nfrom an unknown location -- and that the network, while headless, is\nstill alive.\n", "\nJohn R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control and\ninternational security, echoed those suspicions, saying the network\nstill had a number of undisclosed customers. \"There's more out there\nthan we can discuss publicly,\" Bolton said in April.\n", "\nFederal and private experts said the list of suspected customers\nincludes Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Malaysia, Indonesia,\nAlgeria, Kuwait, Myanmar and Abu Dhabi.\n", "\nGiven the urgency of the Libyan and Khan disclosures, many private\nand governmental experts expected that the Bush administration and\nthe IAEA would work together. But European diplomats said the\nadministration never turned over valuable information to back up its\nwider suspicions about other countries. \"It doesn't like to share,\" a\nsenior European diplomat involved in nuclear intelligence said of the\nUnited States. \"That makes life more difficult. So we're on the\nlearning curve.\"\n", "\nFederal officials said they were reluctant to give the IAEA\nclassified information because the agency is too prone to leaks. The\nagency has 137 member states, and U.S. officials believe some of them\nmay be using the agency to hunt for nuclear secrets. One senior\nadministration official put it this way: \"The cops and the crooks all\nserve on the agency's board together.\"\n", "\nThe result is that two separate, disjointed searches are on for other\nnuclear rogue states -- one by Washington, the other by the IAEA. And\nthere is scant communication between the feuding bureaucracies.\n", "\nThat lack of communication with the U.N. agency extends to the\nNuclear Suppliers Group, a loose organization of countries that\nproduce nuclear equipment. It can stop the export of restricted\natomic technology to a suspect customer, but it does not report its\nactions to the IAEA. Moreover, there is no communication between the\nIAEA and the Bush administration's Proliferation Security Initiative,\nwhich seeks to intercept illicit nuclear trade at sea or in the air.\n", "\n\"It's a legitimate question whether we need a very different kind of\nsuper-agency that can deal with the new world of A.Q. Khans,\" said a\nsenior administration official. \"Because we sure don't have the\nsystem we need now.\"\n", "\nTHE HUNT GOES ON\n", "\nElBaradei, the head of the U.N. agency, says he is plunging ahead,\npursuing his own investigation even as the Bush administration\nattempts to have him replaced when his term expires late next year.\nIn an interview in Vienna, he defended his record, citing the\ninformation he has wrung out of Iran, and his agency's discovery of\ntendrils of Khan's network in more than 30 countries around the\nglobe.\n", "\n\"We're getting an idea of how it works,\" he said of the Khan network.\n\"And we're still looking\" for other suppliers and customers.\n", "\nOne method is to investigate the countries Khan visited before his\narrest. Nuclear experts disclosed that the countries were\nAfghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Ivory Coast, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mali,\nMauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, North Korea, Saudi Arabia,\nSenegal, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. Many of\nthem are Islamic, and several of the African countries are rich in\nuranium ore.\n", "\nIn one of its biggest operations, the agency is hunting for nuclear\nclues in a half-dozen of the network's buildings and warehouses in\nDubai, which for years were used as the central location for\nassembling and repacking centrifuges.\n", "\nBoth in Washington and in Vienna, the most delicate investigations\ninvolve important American allies -- including Egypt and Saudi\nArabia. So far, said European intelligence officials familiar with\nthe agency's inner workings, no hard evidence of clandestine nuclear\narms programs has surfaced.\n", "\nSuspicious signs have emerged, however. For instance, experts\ndisclosed that SMB Computers, Tahir's front company in Dubai for the\nKhan network, made telephone calls to Saudi Arabia. But the company\nalso engaged in legitimate computer sales, giving it plausible cover.\nExperts also disclosed that Saudi scientists traveled to Pakistan for\nsome of Khan's scientific conferences. But the meetings were not\nsecret, or illegal.\n", "\nThere is also worry in both Washington and Vienna about Egypt, which\nhas two research reactors near Cairo and a long history of internal\ndebate about whether to pursue nuclear arms.

Bush praised the Red Sox for\ntheir hustling style of play and touted their organization for\nits long-standing charitable programs, including The Jimmy Fund.

The\ncity's new team, the Nationals, begins regular season play Monday,\nwith a home opener set for April 14, and it remains without a deal to\ntelevise its games. Whatever the local enthusiasm for the Nationals --\nand it appears to be enormous -- the absence of a television\nbroadcasting outlet is an impediment that will undercut early attempts\nto market the new team and give it a running start. This is\nunacceptable, and it is largely the doing of Mr. Angelos.\n", "\nMr. Angelos opposed bringing baseball to Washington on the grounds\nthat it might further damage his Orioles franchise, whose fortunes\nhave nose-dived in the 12 years since he purchased the team. In that\nhe may have a point; last week, the Orioles reported that ticket sales\nwere running 12 percent behind last year's level. He has insisted that\nMajor League Baseball should compensate him for the revenue he\nbelieves the Nationals will leech from the Orioles. According to\npublished reports, he has already received from baseball officials a\nguaranteed minimum price of $365 million should he decide to sell the\nOrioles. That's more than twice the amount Mr. Angelos paid for the\nfranchise in 1993 -- not bad for a team whose attendance has plummeted\non his watch.\n", "\nIf baseball officials want to indemnify Mr. Angelos for his\nanticipated financial losses, that's fine -- but not if the\ncompensation would come at the Nationals' expense. Yet with\nnegotiations in the eleventh hour, the Orioles' owner has insisted on\na prejudicial television broadcasting arrangement that would hold the\nNationals' financial fortunes hostage to his own whims indefinitely.\nClaiming a highly dubious exclusive right to broadcast all baseball in\nthis region, Mr. Angelos says Nationals games could be shown on his\nown Orioles regional network; in return for airing its games, he says\nhe would offer the Washington team a ``fair and appropriate fee'' --\nbut not an equity stake in the network or a percentage of broadcast\nprofits. In fact, such a deal is a rip-off that would deflate the\nNationals' value and imperil the task of finding a buyer for the\nfranchise -- an orphan that is now the collective property of\nbaseball's 29 team owners. What prospective Nationals' owner would\ncede control of broadcasting rights to a rival -- to say nothing of a\nrival as truculent as Mr. Angelos? Might as well trade away the team's\nbest sluggers and star pitchers.\n", "\nMr. Angelos has threatened to sue unless he gets his way. Evidently\nhoping to avoid the drawn-out, bare-knuckled litigation for which he\nis notorious, baseball officials have kept negotiations alive. But the\ntalks have gone on for six months, and time's up. The season starts\nnext week, and Washington's baseball-starved fans want to tune in.\nLawyers say Mr. Angelos's legal position is weak.

A further unusual property\nis that the genetic region has a much more ancient\nlineage than most human genes, and the researchers suggest, as\none possible explanation, that it could have entered the human\ngenome through interbreeding with one of the archaic human lineages\nthat developed in parallel with that of modern humans.\n", "\nThe genetic region was discovered by scientists at DeCode Genetics, a\nbiotechnology company in Reykjavik, Iceland, which has made the Icelandic\npopulation, with its comprehensive genealogy and medical records, a prime\nhunting ground for the genetic roots of common diseases. Their\nfinding is published in Monday's issue of Nature Genetics in\na report by Kari Stefansson, Augustine Kong, Hreinn Stefansson and\nother DeCode scientists.\n", "\nThe report seems likely to receive considerable attention, even though it\nraises as many questions as it answers. \"I thought it\nwas one of the most interesting papers in population genetics\nI have ever read,\" said Nick Patterson, a mathematician at\nthe Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., who advised DeCode on\nthe article but has no other connection with the company.\n", "\nThe DNA region came to light during the search for a\nschizophrenia-causing gene, which turned out not to be there. But\nthe DeCode researchers noticed that the DNA sequences they had\nexamined did not seem to agree with those in the\nstandard human genome sequence, said Kari Stefansson, DeCode's chief executive.\n", "\nThe lack of agreement turned out to be caused by the\nfact that the region exists in two forms in the\nIcelandic population. The region is not a single gene but\na vast section of DNA, some 900,000 units in length,\nsituated in the 17th of the 23 pairs of human\nchromosomes. In some Icelanders, the DeCode team found, the section\nruns in the standard direction, but in others it is\nflipped. Looking for any physical consequence, the DeCode researchers found\nthat women carrying the inverted section tended to have slightly\nmore children.\n", "\nThe section carries several known genes, not one of which has\nany obvious connection with fertility. It is not clear why\ninverting the section should have any effect on the number\nof children, Stefansson said. But the inversion does increase the\nrate of recombination, the shuffling of genes between generations that\nis a major source of genetic novelty. That could account\nfor some of the increase in fertility.\n", "\nThe DeCode scientists found that the chromosome-17 inversion is rare in\nAfricans and almost absent in Asians, but is present in\n20 percent of Europeans, the same frequency as in Iceland.\nThe inversion seems to have been favored by natural selection\namong Europeans in fairly recent times, perhaps the past 10,000\nyears. \"Maybe something switched it on in the European environment,\nsuch as an interaction with diet,\" said David Reich, a\npopulation geneticist at the Broad Institute.\n", "\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n", "\nFertility is without doubt affected by different genes in different populations,\nand DeCode found a genetic element special to Europeans because\nthat is where it was looking. The increased frequency of\nthe inversion in Europeans is one of a growing number\nof examples of recent human evolution.\n", "\nThe inversion itself, however, is surprisingly ancient. Its age is revealed\nby its counterpart, the standard or noninverted section of chromosome\n17. The standard and inverted regions cannot exchange genetic elements\nduring recombination because their DNA sequences do not match. Hence,\nunlike most of the rest of the genome, which gets\nshuffled in each generation, the two forms have existed separately\nsince their creation. This event presumably happened when the region\ncame adrift from its parent chromosome and got knitted back\nin the opposite way.\n", "\nWhen all the known versions of a human gene are compared,\nin most cases they turn out to have had a\nsingle common ancestor about a million years ago. But the\nstandard and flipped versions of the chromosome 17 region last\nshared a common ancestor 3 million years ago. It is\nhighly unusual for two versions of a gene to endure\nfor so long, because one will usually get lost by\na natural process of elimination.\n", "\nThe DeCode researchers propose two explanations. One is that the standard\nand flipped versions confer different advantages, so that it is\nbeneficial for a person to have inherited a copy of\neach from different parents. This balancing selection can keep two\nversions of a gene around in a population indefinitely.\n", "\nDeCode's alternative proposal is that the flipped version was carried for\nmany years in a different human lineage, one of the\narchaic populations that preceded the emergence of anatomically modern humans\nin Africa 150,000 years ago. Then, in some episode of\ninterbreeding, a single copy of the flipped version entered the\nmodern human lineage some time before humans left Africa 60,000\nyears ago.\n", "\nIn support of this view, the flipped version carries far fewer\nmutations than does the standard version, as if it had\nbeen accumulating them from a much more recent date. There\nhave been other recent hints of modern human interaction with\narchaic hominids, notably the finding in October that a lineage\nof body lice seems to have been inherited from a\ndifferent human species.\n", "\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n", "\nStefansson said that another property of the inversion, though one not\ndescribed in Monday's article, was that it is associated with\nlongevity. DeCode scientists have located two sites on Icelanders' genomes\nwhere there is some genetic variant that promotes longer lifespan.\nThe chromosome 17 inversion, it turns out, lies at one\nof these sites. It occurs at much higher frequency in\nwomen over 95 and in men over 90 than in\nthe normal population. \"It seems to confer on people the\nability to live to extreme old age,\" Stefansson said.\n", "\nIt is particularly surprising that the same genetic element should promote\nfertility and longevity, because most organisms are obliged to follow\na strategy either of breeding fast during short lives or\nof living longer and having fewer children. \"Usually people think\nof there being a tradeoff between fertility and longevity.

Rutan\nwon the $10 million Ansari X Prize for the advancement\nof space tourism.\n", "\nThe Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer -- first sketched by Rutan on\nthe back of a napkin in 1999 -- is undoubtedly\none of the strangest-looking flying machines ever to take wing\nover the Kansas heartland.\n", "\nBuilt by Rutan's Scaled Composites of Mojave, Calif., it consists of\ntwo 44-foot lightweight carbon fiber torpedoes joined at the hip.\nA cigar-shaped cockpit is suspended between, with a single jet\nengine -- a modified turbofan like those used in corporate\njets -- mounted above and behind the cockpit.

Commercial airliners carry less than\nhalf their weight in fuel.\n", "\nAt takeoff, because so much fuel is stored in the plane's\nhollow wings, they will droop to within 3 feet of\nthe runway -- meaning any sudden gust of wind could\nbecome an adventure-ending disaster.\n", "\n\"It's an experimental aircraft with such lightweight construction there's a risk\nof structural failure,\" Fossett says. \"The first time it flies\nwith a full load of fuel will be when I\ntake off on the mission.

A company called Winergy LLC\napplied for an offshore wind farm permit from the Norfolk District of\nthe Army Corps of Engineers, but that application has been withdrawn.\n", "\nIn New York, the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) plans to build\n40 wind turbines off southern Long Island as part of a state program\nthat requires utilities to produce 25 percent of their energy\nportfolio from renewable sources by 2013. ``We would be discouraged by\nany effort that would prevent us from moving forward with this\nimportant project,'' LIPA Chairman Richard Kessel said.\n"], "NYT_ENG_20041209.0004": ["\n", "\nGreen Mountain Energy is offering Texas electricity consumers an\nenvironmentally friendly service at a rate matching that of Reliant\nEnergy -- a sign of a growing interest in green energy and the rising\nprice of traditionally produced power.\n", "\nTouted as a \"pollution free\" plan, Green Mountain Energy gets the\npower it sells from wind turbines and hydroelectric plants and will\ncost about 11.1 cents per kilowatt-hour, the same price current\nReliant Energy customers are paying.\n", "\nHouston-area electricity customers can pay as little as 9.6 cents per\nkilowatt-hour, a rate offered by Houston-based Gexa Energy. Other\ncompanies, like Starlight Electric and Cirro Energy, also offer rates\nbelow the price Reliant charges.\n", "\nThe Green Mountain plan, a 10 percent wind- and 90 percent\nwater-generated mix, is about $9 per month less expensive than the\n100 percent wind plan Austin-based Green Mountain currently offers,\nbased on the use by a typical customer.\n", "\nThe new offering reflects a maturing of the electricity market from\none where only early adopters would pay the extra money for green\npower to a market where renewable power is attractive to a broader\nrange of customers, said John Savage, Green Mountain's senior vice\npresident of marketing.\n", "\n\"Some see it as a way to counter the country's dependence on foreign\noil; others see it as a way to promote good environmental\nstewardship, and others see it as being consistent with their faith.\"\nSavage said.\n", "\nThe power in Green Mountain's 100 percent wind plan comes from\nturbines operating in Texas, but most of the hydroelectric power in\nthe new plan is generated in neighboring states, such as Arkansas and\nOklahoma, Savage said.\n", "\nWhile the power that arrives at a Green Mountain customer's home in\nTexas won't necessarily be from a hydroelectric plant, Green Mountain\nwill buy a sort of \"renewable power credit\" from a hydro plant that\ngenerated the electricity and sold it to another user.\n", "\nGreen Mountain's plan also reflects the narrowing price gap between\nrenewable power and power made by more traditional methods, such as\ncoal and natural gas, said Tim Morstad, an analyst with Consumers\nUnion.\n", "\nSince 2002, the price electric consumers pay to Reliant Energy, known\nas the price-to-beat, has gone up 28 percent, or 2.48 cents per\nkilowatt-hour. Most of that is a result of rising costs, primarily\nnatural gas.\n", "\n\"On the renewable front, it does bode well that customers can choose\nmore environmentally friendly power for the price most residential\ncustomers pay,\" Morstad said. \"But this is also a signal that the\nprice to beat has gotten very high.\"\n", "\nThe cost of renewable energy hasn't necessarily dropped, either.\nWhile the cost of wind power is supposed to stay relatively stable\ncompared with power generated by coal and natural gas, Green Mountain\nrecently increased the price of its 100 percent wind product. Because\nthe company must buy some power on the open market to meet customer\nneeds, it is also subject to the fuel price increases imposed by its\nsuppliers, Savage said.\n", "\nReliant Energy does not offer a renewable energy plan in the Houston\narea -- state electricity deregulation laws allow it to offer only\none plan here until Jan. 1, 2005 -- but it has offered a plan to\nDallas-area customers for several years.\n", "\nJim Robb, Reliant's senior vice president of retail marketing, said\nthe renewable plan has been priced to roughly match the cost of the\nDallas area's incumbent provider, TXU. The power comes from a\ncombination of wind and landfill-produced natural gas.\n", "\n\"We haven't seen major evidence of increased interest in a renewable\nproduct,\" Robb said, noting that about 1,400 customers have signed on\nto its plan. \"We could offer such a plan in Houston next year if we\nfind customer demand, but we haven't gone to the expense of marketing\nthe plan.\"\n", "\nThere are no other renewable energy plans offered in the Houston\narea. Spokesmen for Entergy and TXU note that renewable sources are\npart of their mix of power generation. TXU is the fourth largest\ncontractor of wind power in the country, while Entergy has several\nhydroelectric facilities.\n", "\nGreen Mountain has 600,000 customers in eight states but does not\noffer a state-by-state breakdown.\n"]}}
