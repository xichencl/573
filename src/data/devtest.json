Those with the disorder frequently eat\nlarge amounts of food while feeling at a loss to control their\neating.\n", "\nTo date, there are no approved medications to treat binge-eating\ndisorder, but a large, multi-center study may offer hope to the 2\npercent of the population who suffer from it.\n", "\nDr. Nathan Shapira, an assistant professor of psychiatry of the\nUniversity of Florida's College of Medicine, is among the researchers\ntesting the effectiveness of topiramate, a drug developed to treat\nthe convulsions and seizures of epilepsy, in controlling binge\neating.\n", "\nShapira said that when topiramate was used for epilepsy patients,\nmany reported that they also had a marked decrease in appetite and\neven lost weight. A small study of some 60 patients with binge eating\ndisorder showed that those who received the topiramate rather than a\nplacebo binged less often and also lost weight.\n", "\nThe new study will test the effectiveness of topiramate in 350 binge\neaters from around the country, Shapira said. Results are anticipated\nnext year. It is funded by Ortho McNeil Pharmaceutical, which makes\nthe drug.\n", "\nBinge eating disorder, Shapira emphasizes, is not the same as\nindulging in an occasional binge at the table or \"grazing\" through an\narray of buffet offerings.\n", "\n\"Everyone probably binges at some point, particularly during\n'sanctioned' events like Thanksgiving dinner,\" Shapira said. \"The\nreal difference between 'grazing' and binge eating is eating much\nmore than normal in a short period of time, often less than two\nhours.\n", "\n\"It's a terrible situation to be surrounded by food when that's all\nthat you are thinking about,\" he said.\n", "\nAfter a binge, he said, binge eaters feel disgusted with themselves.\nAs a result, they often eat alone or very rapidly, and will eat until\nthey are uncomfortably full. Unlike eating disorders such as bulimia\nnervosa or anorexia where victims are predominantly female, the ratio\nof female to male binge eaters is about 3-to-2. It is common in all\nethnic groups.\n", "\nAlmost all who have this disorder are either overweight or obese. It\nhas been estimated that up to 30 percent of those in weight-loss\nprograms have a binge-eating disorder. They usually develop a weight\nproblem earlier in life and do not do as well in these programs. One\nstudy looking at Overeaters Anonymous found that 70 percent of the\nmembers had a binge eating disorder, Shapira said.\n", "\nThe major complications of binge eating disorder are the diseases\nthat accompany obesity. These include diabetes, high blood pressure,\nhigh cholesterol levels, gallbladder disease, heart disease and\ncertain types of cancer. The causes of the disorder are still\nunknown, but up to half of all people with binge eating disorder have\na history of depression.\n", "\nWhether depression is a cause or effect is unclear, according to the\nNational Institutes of Health. Many people report that anger,\nsadness, boredom, anxiety or other negative emotions can trigger a\nbinge episode.\n", "\n\"There's a lack of recognition that this disorder is very common and\ntreatable,\" Shapira said.\n", "\nFor those who think they might have an eating problem, he suggests\ntwo questions: Do you eat a lot of food in a short period? Do you\nfeel out of control as you do so?\n", "\nThose who answer \"yes\" to both should consider whether they have a\nbinge-eating disorder.\n", "\n(Diane Chun writes for The Gainesville (Fla.)

Ultimately, he speculated, it could lead to\nadvances that would help infertile women.\n", "\nDr. Rexford Ahima, at the University of Pennsylvania School of\nMedicine's Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, said\nthe study suggested that leptin is the signal that links fat tissue\nto the brain and instructs it to control menstruation.\n", "\nAhima agreed that leptin might have potential as a fertility\ntreatment.

The American Psychiatric Association's manual has a Not\nOtherwise Specified category for many disorders, whenever symptoms\nare so vague, so mild or so untreatable that it doesn't seem to\nwarrant the full-fledged diagnosis. With the manual continually under\nrevision, the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is the place where new\ndiagnoses emerge.\n", "\nFor instance, the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome, a variant of\nautism, was pulled from a collection of disorders previously labeled\nPervasive Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.\n", "\nMuch is at stake in whether a condition is elevated to the status of\na full-fledged diagnosis.

Its definitions help\ndetermine such practical matters as insurance reimbursement,\ncompetence and eligibility for disability. But they also help\ndetermine something more elusive, and probably more important:\nwhether someone's behavior should be considered a personality quirk\nor a symptom of mental illness.\n", "\nNow, in the diagnostic category of eating disorders, the search for\ngreater specificity in the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is\ngenerating much attention.\n", "\n\"The Future of EDNOS\" was a topic at an international meeting on\neating disorders in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, last month, and it is\nthe title of a book expected to be released in Europe next year.\n", "\nTo some observers, this new attention comes not a moment too soon.\n", "\n\"EDNOS right now is a real hodgepodge,\" said Dr. B.

But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge\nand vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week,\nthen we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa.\"\n", "\nThe history of eating disorders has been a gradual one as the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual has been revised through the years.\nAnorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual\npublished in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the\nsame edition. Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next\nedition, which came out in 1987.\n", "\nAnorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent -- or about 1.5 million\nto 11 million American women -- at some point in life, according to\nthe National Institute of Mental Health.

The disorder is much like\nbulimia nervosa, but without the purging.\n", "\nThe \"provisional\" designation highlights the need for more research\ninto a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge\neating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a\nseparate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.\n", "\n\"That's one of most compelling reasons to get something out of the\nNot Otherwise Specified category,\" said Dr. Michael First, associate\nprofessor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia.

But neither meets the strict\ncriteria for bulimia nervosa.\n", "\nPeople with purging disorder, Keel said, are of normal weight, and\nthey purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.\n", "\nRight now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the EDNOS\ncategory. And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists\nask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much\nmore will be known, Keel said.\n", "\n\"Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had\na low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer\nskips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or\ndiuretics to control weight,\" Keel wrote in an e-mail message. \"It's\nvery difficult to learn more about a problem if you never ask any\nquestions about it.\"\n", "\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n", "\nAs First sees it, several criteria must be met before a diagnosis is\npulled out of the Not Otherwise Specified category and into a\nstand-alone diagnosis.

Second, there has to be evidence of an existing\nand effective treatment.\n", "\nThe criterion of an effective treatment has prevented many conditions\nfrom being entered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. In the\n1980s, there was an effort to include \"sadistic personality\ndisorder.\" But it failed, said First, because no treatment existed.\n\"We could have decided to call something sadistic personality\ndisorder,\" he said, \"but if there's no treatment, what would be the\npoint?\"\n", "\nThe third criterion for removing a condition from the Not Otherwise\nSpecified category is the trickiest to meet. It relates to a kind of\ndiagnosis-creep. Experts working on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\npanels must ask how close the condition is to behavior that could be\nconsidered normal. For binge eating disorder, for instance, they must\nask: When is such behavior a true psychiatric condition, and when is\nit the kind of thing that almost everyone engages in every\nThanksgiving?\n", "\n\"This is the matter of what we call false positives,\" First said.\n\"It's the danger of defining as a psychiatric syndrome a set of\nsymptoms that normal people have.\"\n", "\nWhen a new category is created in the manual, he said, \"you're trying\nto identify a category that will help patients get treatment.\"\n", "\n\"But,\" he continued, \"you're worried that this category is going to\nbe applied to normal people as well.\"\n", "\nSome psychiatrists want to create a different label for EDNOS,\ncalling it instead \"mixed eating disorder\" or \"atypical eating\ndisorder.\" But Walsh of Columbia said that would be merely a cosmetic\nchange.\n", "\n\"If I'm a clinician and I get a call from a school saying, 'Hey, I've\ngot a person with mixed eating disorder coming over,' I don't know if\nI'm going to be seeing someone who weighs 80 pounds or 280 pounds,\"\nhe said. \"The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on\ntheir ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively\nhomogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability\nto shortcut a full assessment.\"\n", "\nDiagnostic labels, said Walsh, \"allow big shortcuts.\"\n", "\nKeel, on the other hand, prefers the term \"mixed eating disorder\"\nover EDNOS.

Merck,\nwhich knew Vioxx was in competition with similar drugs, then conducted\nfurther trials, largely to find out if Vioxx could be legitimately\nrecommended for other conditions. Through this process, Merck\ndiscovered that Vioxx did indeed carry a small but unacceptable risk\nof cardiac problems when used for longer than 18 months. Competition\ncombined with regulation forced the drug off the market. And if courts\ndetermine that Merck was negligent, the company will pay a heavy price\nin compensation.\n", "\nOn its own, this incident does not make a good argument for more\nstringent FDA approval procedures. Extensive and lengthy pre-approval\ntesting of the sort that would have kept Vioxx -- and all other drugs --\nunder examination for years ultimately would have harmed more patients\nthan it would have helped. As hundreds of patients' groups can attest,\nthere are high costs when the FDA does not approve drugs quickly, even\ndrugs with serious side effects. People die every day waiting for new\ntreatments.\n", "\nBut the Vioxx withdrawal should inspire some sharper thought about\nwhat happens to drugs once they have been approved, and whether the\nFDA should have the authority to mandate more thorough, ongoing,\nlong-term testing. This is a safety issue, but also an economic one.\nVioxx is a new-generation painkiller, one of several that are (or\nwere) prescribed instead of aspirin or other over-the-counter drugs.\nVioxx was easier on the stomach than aspirin, but it cost more.

Or were they persuaded to do so by Merck's\nadvertising?\n", "\nAccording to studies carried out by the Kaiser Family Foundation\nand others, the pharmaceutical industry's advertising encourages some\npeople to consult doctors, which is a good thing, particularly for\nthose who may not have known they have, say, high cholesterol or blood\npressure.

The solution is not a total ban on advertising, as some\nsuggest, but rather more clinical trials of drugs, aimed specifically\nat determining effectiveness as well as long-term safety. It is in the\ninsurance industry's interest, the FDA's interest and the federal\ngovernment's interest -- because the federal government is a major\nprovider of health insurance -- either to require drug companies to\nconduct such comparative tests or to set up a neutral agency to do so.\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from the Vioxx withdrawal, surely\nit is the need for renewed attention to evidence-based medicine and\nevidence-based drug prescription as well.\n"], "NYT_ENG_20041015.0265": ["\n", "\nPfizer Inc. warned doctors on Friday that one of its bestselling\npainkillers, Bextra, might increase the risk of a heart attack or\nstroke in coronary artery bypass surgery patients.

As a result, they said,\nthere was no reason to stop the advertising campaign.\n", "\n``We were acting totally consistent with the data we had,''\nGilmartin said. ``We undertook right away to ask the right\nquestions.'' The company was trying to get at cardiovascular risk, he\nsaid, by initiating three clinical trials that would together give\nimportant new information on the issue. Many doctors and patients\nliked Vioxx's track record on gastrointestinal problems, a major\nsource of worry for arthritis patients.\n", "\nBut, on the phone call, when Kim delivered the new, more damaging\nresults, Gilmartin's choices were bleak. Even if the painkiller stayed\non the market, sales would almost certainly plummet because its\nadvertising would be restricted and would have to carry a ``black\nbox'' warning about the heart attack risks.\n", "\nGilmartin was clear that the trial should be halted and that the\ndrug might have to be taken off the market. ``Look Peter, we're going\nto make this decision based on what's in the best interest of science\nand patient safety,'' Gilmartin recalled saying. ``It's not that we're\nunaware of the consequences, but it's a deep-seated belief that if you\ndo the right thing, rewards will follow,'' he said of the decision to\npull the drug.\n", "\nThe decision was also sound litigation strategy. The company was\nalready facing two class action lawsuits alleging patient harm from\nVioxx. Anything that smacked of a cover-up would have strengthened the\nplaintiffs' hands.\n", "\n``Running away from your problems, denial, is the worst possible\nchoice,'' said Anthony Sabino, professor of business law at St. John's\nUniversity.\n", "\nOver the next three days, Kim and his researchers convened three\nteleconferences with about 15 outside medical experts to get their\nadvice. By then, Kim said, he was leaning toward pulling the drug. But\nthe outside experts, most of whom had done previous work with Merck\nand were offered a fee for their consultation, had surprisingly mixed\nopinions.\n", "\nA sizable group were reluctant to give up a painkiller proven to\nhave fewer gastrointestinal side effects than others and were not\nconvinced the available alternatives were any safer, participants\nsaid.

Duke\nUniversity cardiologist Robert Califf argued strenuously on one\nteleconference for keeping the drug on the market with a much stronger\nwarning label. He had been railing publicly for some time about the\nabsence of long-term cardiovascular risk studies on painkillers, a\nsituation that he said made selecting the right drug a ``total\ncrapshoot.''\n", "\nIn his view, the new Vioxx data quantified the risk and made it\nmanageable. ``The curves show not even a hint of a detrimental effect\nfor 18 months,'' and even after that the risks did not appear that\nlarge. ``I thought the risk was going to be larger than it was,'' he\nsaid.\n", "\nBut Northwestern University rheumatologist Thomas Schnitzer argued\nfor ditching Vioxx entirely because Merck's scientists could not\nexplain why the drug started causing heart attacks after 18 months.\nFurthermore, Merck's carefully cultivated image would go out the\nwindow if Vioxx stayed on the market, he said, because Merck ``prides\nitself on its ethical approach. I couldn't see Merck saying we're\ngoing to market a drug with a safety problem.''\n", "\nAt lunchtime on Monday, Sept. 27, it was time to make a final\ndecision. Kim, Frazier and Gilmartin gathered in the chief executive's\nconference room at the Whitehouse Station, N.J., campus.

In 2001, the agency formally warned\nthe company against misleading doctors about those risks, and in 2002,\nthe FDA required stiffer wording on the drug label.\n", "\nNonetheless, the agency had agreed with Merck that the 2000 study\nhad too many confounding aspects to be definitive. The national\nadverse event reporting system that helps the FDA flag dangerous side\neffects was of little use in this case because the ailments possibly\ncaused by Vioxx -- heart attacks and strokes -- are so common.\n", "\nGalson also said that Vioxx safety follow-up was complicated by the\nfact that it is unethical to give placebos to arthritic patients,\nbecause their pain needs treatment. Instead the FDA strongly supported\nthe Merck decision to use three placebo-controlled trials in healthy\npeople to test whether the drug was protective against prostate and\ncolon cancer and colon polyps and also to study cardiovascular risk.\n", "\nThe FDA's own study of the Vioxx safety issue has become mired in\ncontroversy. The FDA safety officer in charge of the report, David\nGraham, concluded that Vioxx posed much greater cardiovascular risk\nthan the other major drug in its class, Celebrex. He presented that\ninformation at a French conference this summer. Galson has said,\nhowever, that he only saw a short abstract of the study and so could\nnot act on its conclusions, a contention that Graham disputes.\n", "\nThe controversy grew Friday when Grassley asked Merck, among other\nthings, about an e-mail provided by Graham in which a Merck official\ncomplained that the FDA had not lived up to a prior agreement to alert\nthe company before releasing any negative information about its\nproducts.\n", "\nThe FDA's opportunity to act independently on Vioxx ended on Sept.\n27, when the fax came from Merck asking for an urgent meeting with\nsenior officials.

But if\nthe findings hold up, \"they essentially buy us time\" to address those\nissues, said Andrew C. Baker of the Marine Program of the Wildlife\nConservation Society, who led the new work.\n", "\nAlgae and corals live in a symbiotic relationship. Coral polyps\nabsorb and shelter the algae, and as the algae photosynthesize they\nproduce sugars that the corals use for energy.

I suspect it's a bit of both.\"\n", "\nThe result is coral bereft of much of its power supply. The living\npolyps that give coral reefs their color wither, usually leaving\nlifeless white skeleton reefs of calcium carbonate.

If so, he\nsaid, \"some of the doom and gloom might not be as bad as had been\nsuggested.\"\n", "\nThe findings are \"definitely good news,\" said Nancy Knowlton, an\nexpert on corals who directs the Center for Marine Biodiversity and\nConservation of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the\nUniversity of California, San Diego.\n", "\nBaker and his colleagues studied corals affected by El Nino-Southern\nOscillation events, natural disruptions of ocean currents that occur\nperiodically and that can cause ocean temperatures to rise in one\narea or another. In particular, they studied what happened to corals\nin relatively shallow waters off the Pacific coast of Panama, and in\nthe Indian Ocean off Kenya and Mauritius. All the corals they studied\nwere colonized by Symbiodinium algae, a diverse genus whose various\nspecies look alike but react differently to heat.\n", "\nUsing DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those\nthree sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf,\nwhich are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the\nRed Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where\nalgae strains are less heat-tolerant.\n", "\nThe scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had\nexperienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions\nof a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D. By contrast, reefs off\nMauritius, where waters remained cooler, had fewer symbiont D algae.\nThey resembled the reefs of the Red Sea, Baker said.\n", "\nBaker said these findings, reported in the journal Nature in August,\nsuggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event,\nheat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them. Symbiont D \"is\nbecoming more common on reefs that are experiencing bleaching\nevents,\" Baker said. He said the findings were the first \"real-world\nevidence\" that corals might adapt to warming.\n", "\nBut this kind of adaptation may not be enough \"to let corals off the\nhook,\" as Knowlton of the Scripps Institution put it in an interview.\n", "\nFor example, according to a report issued this month by the Global\nCoral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what\nconditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.\nThey do not even know if changes occur when corals recruit different\nalgae from the water around them, or if something somehow changes the\nratio of algae strains growing within them.\n", "\nAlso, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized\nwith new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with\nother strains. For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant\nalgae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to\nproviding sustenance to their coral hosts. And though symbiont D is\nwidespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not\nknow whether all of them can support the strain.\n", "\nAnswers to those questions await more research, and she said the\nstudy of corals was still developing. \"If it were birds it would be\n18th- or 19th-century science -- who's living with whom, where,\" she\nsaid.\n", "\nHistory suggests that the coral bleaching and mortality associated\nwith the severe El Nino phenomenon of 1997-98 was a thousand-year\nevent, according to the monitoring network's coral report. That\nmeans, in theory, that there is only a 1-in-1,000 chance that similar\neffects would be seen in a given year.
