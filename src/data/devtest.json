As with other substances\nclassified as dietary supplements, the FDA can restrict the sale of\nan herbal product only if it receives well-documented reports of\nhealth problems associated with it.

Also, the commission late last year issued its first set\nof advertising guidelines aimed specifically at the supplement\nindustry.\n", "\n   Still, the current regulations have created a quagmire of\nconsumer confusion and set up potential health crises that even\nindustry officials say could ultimately hurt producers as well as\nusers of herbal products. Under the 1994 law, consumers have no\nassurance that an herbal product contains what the label says it\ndoes or that it is free from harmful contaminants. Independent\nanalyses of some products, particularly those containing costly or\nscarce herbs, revealed that some have little or none of the\npurported active ingredient listed on the label.\n", "\n   Adding to the confusion is that botanical makers are allowed to\ndescribe products only in terms of their effects on the structure\nor function of the body, not their potential health benefits. Thus,\na product label might say ``promotes cardiac function'' but it\ncannot say ``lowers cholesterol.''\n", "\n   Likewise, although the law does allow health warnings on the\nlabel, most manufacturers have yet to include them.\n", "\n   Consumers are warned, however, that federal drug safety\nofficials are not watching the store. All botanicals must display a\ndisclaimer on the label following the description of the product's\nstructural or functional role: ``This statement has not been\nevaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not\nintended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.'' To\nwhich Tyler commented, ``If that is true, why on earth would anyone\nuse it?''\n", "\n   The seeds of the modern herbal market were sown in the '60s when\n``green, organic and natural became buzzwords,'' Tyler said. But\nthey did not mature until the '90s with the growing consumer\ninterest in ``self-care and controlling one's destiny,'' he said.\nMany turned to herbs as a gentler way to treat health problems and\na potential tool for preserving mental and physical health.\n", "\n   The interest has spawned scores of Internet sites and hundreds\nof books on various herbs. But much of the literature is replete\nwith poorly documented health claims and, with few exceptions\n(among them, Tyler's books), advocacy prevails over objectivity.\n", "\n   Because plants contain a mixture of relatively diluted\nchemicals, they naturally tend to have milder actions, both in\ntheir therapeutic benefits and side effects, than the concentrated,\nsingle chemicals in most drugs. Thus, botanicals generally take\nlonger to act than regular pharmaceuticals and few have the potency\nof a prescription, the one possible exception being saw palmetto,\nwhich a well-designed study indicated may be as helpful for an\nenlarged prostate as the more expensive and riskier drug, Proscar.\n", "\n   The combination of chemicals in botanicals is potentially both a\nplus and a minus. When two or more chemicals enhance one another's\nactivity, the therapeutic benefit could theoretically exceed that\nof an isolated substance formulated as a drug. Mark Blumenthal, who\nheads the American Botanical Council, noted that the herb St.\nJohn's wort, widely used in Germany and increasingly in the United\nStates to counter mild depression, is standardized for a substance\ncalled hypericin. But, he explained, ``hypericin is not directly\nlinked to its antidepressant activity.'' Rather, other substances\nin the herb seem to have diverse actions on brain chemicals, all of\nwhich work together to counter depression.\n", "\n   Equally possible, though, when using an herb with two or more\nactive chemicals, is that one will cancel the benefits of another\nor introduce a hazard. Without careful chemical tests and large,\nwell-controlled clinical trials such actions are often hard to\ndetect.\n", "\n   Consumer confidence in herbal medicine is bolstered by the\ncommon but erroneous assumption that ``natural'' equals ``safe''\nand the public's failure to realize that many plants contain\nchemicals that are potent drugs or outright poisons. Natural\nlaxatives like the herb Cascara sagrada are just as habit-forming\nand harmful to the colon as laxatives sold as drugs.\n", "\n   nn\n", "\n   Indeed, one quarter of prescription drugs and hundreds of\nover-the-counter products were originally isolated from plants.\nEphedra, for example, contains a natural stimulant that is approved\nfor use as a decongestant and bronchial dilator in some\npharmaceutical products. However, when used in uncontrolled dosages\nor by people with certain underlying health problems, it can cause\na dangerous rise in blood pressure and, in its herbal form, has\nbeen responsible for serious adverse reactions and dozens of\ndeaths, mainly among people who inappropriately used it as a\nstimulant or diet aid.\n", "\n   Complicating the safety issue is the fact, shown in several\nrecent surveys, that most patients fail to tell their physicians\nthey use herbal supplements and thus sometimes risk dangerous drug\ninteractions or endure costly tests or treatments when an herb\ncauses an unrecognized side effect. Experts say many patients\nwithhold information about herbal drug use because they fear being\nridiculed by their doctors.\n", "\n   Although all German physicians must take courses on herbal\nremedies, only a handful of American medical and pharmacology\nschools offer courses in this field.\n", "\n   A year ago, the President's Commission on Dietary Supplement\nLabels recommended that the FDA appoint a committee to evaluate the\nsafety and effectiveness of herbal products. ``This could be the\nmost important step in the United States toward legitimizing herbal\nmedicine,'' Tyler said.\n", "\n   However, the agency responded that it lacked the budget to\nsupport such an effort. American physicians have completed and\npublished only a few well-designed studies of some popular\nbotanicals. Among them were studies showing that saw palmetto can\nshrink an enlarged prostate and ginkgo biloba can improve memory in\npatients with early Alzheimer's disease.\n", "\n   The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of\nHealth is helping to finance a three-year multicenter study of St.\nJohn's wort as a treatment for clinical depression and a study of\nplant-based estrogens as a preventive for postmenopausal health\nproblems.\n", "\n   However, thousands of studies of botanicals have been completed\nabroad _ mainly in Germany _ that strongly suggest a\nhealth-promoting role for more than 200 plant products. Germany's\nCommission E evaluated 380 botanicals, approving 254 as safe and\nreasonably effective and disapproving 126 as ineffective, unsafe or\nboth.\n", "\n   The Germans use a different criterion to assess an herb's\nbenefits _ a doctrine of ``reasonable certainty'' that the herb has\nthe desired effect and is safe, Blumenthal said.

With the baby boomers growing older,\nMcGlashan sensed a growing demand for natural medicines the Chinese\nhave used for centuries.\n", "\n   nn\n", "\n   McGlashan says he had a vision for his business; he wanted to\napply ``pharmaceutical rigors'' to the dietary supplement industry,\nusing research to persuade consumers that Eastern therapies worked.\nIn early 1994, he Dr. Michael Chang, a medical chemist and former\npharmaceutical industry researcher who had set up a manufacturing\nplant to produce herbal medicines in Huzhou, China, near Shanghai.\n", "\n   Chang scoured Chinese research for promising herbal products and\nidentified 5,000; together, he and McGlashan narrowed the list to\n30. By early 1995, Pharmanex was born, with headquarters in Simi\nValley, Calif. Red yeast rice, called Hong Qu, was one of the most\npromising projects on its list.\n", "\n   ``We know Hong Qu has been used for centuries, but we don't know\nwhy it lowers cholesterol,'' Chang said. ``We need to find out.''\n", "\n   The 1994 law, McGlashan said, made it worth investing in\nscience. The company introduced Cholestin at the end of 1996, after\nnearly three years of study. Most recently, Pharmanex enlisted Dr.\nDavid Heber, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles, to study the effects of\nCholestin in adults with moderately elevated cholesterol.\n", "\n   The study, financed by Pharmanex, compared the cholesterol\nlevels of 42 adults who took 2.5 grams of Cholestin every day for\nthree months with the levels in 41 adults who were given placebos.\nHeber said the total cholesterol counts of those who took the\nsupplement dropped, on average, from 250 to 210.\n", "\n   Heber dismisses the contention that red yeast rice is a drug;\ninstead he calls it ``a functional food.'' The same\ncholesterol-lowering ingredient in lovastatin, he notes, occurs in\neven higher concentrations in oyster mushrooms, commonly used in\nAsian cooking. And nobody, he said, is trying to ban mushrooms.\n", "\n   However, Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of psychopharmacology\nat New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, contends the current\ndistinction between dietary supplements and drugs is based on\nsemantics, not biology, and that both should be carefully\nregulated. ``If there is a biologically active component in the\nsupplement, to say it is not a drug is illogical because it will\nhave a similar effect,'' he said. Companies like Pharmanex, he\nadded, ``want to be able to implant the idea in the public that the\ndrug is medically beneficial'' without doing rigorous research drug\ncompanies must do to obtain approval.\n", "\n   That kind of science, McGlashan admits, would cost far too much\nfor a small company like his. Yet with a decent body of research\nbehind Cholestin, he said, he at one time envisioned himself\nbecoming the FDA's poster boy for good behavior.\n", "\n   Instead, he received a visit from FDA investigators in April of\nlast year; the agency had received complaints that Cholestin\ncontained lovastatin, both from a pharmacist and from Merck &AMP; Co,\nthe pharmaceutical company that manufactures Mevacor, the\ncholestorol-lowering drug that contains the same ingredient as\nCholestin.\n", "\n   Shortly thereafter, federal authorities impounded 10 tons of red\nyeast rice that had come into the Port of Los Angeles from China;\nthe shipment is now sitting in a storage facility in Mexico. Then\non May 20, the FDA notified McGlashan that it considered Cholestin\nillegal, a move that prompted the company to ask for a hearing\nbefore Kimball of the U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.\n", "\n   McGlashan contends that, at its root, the dispute is an economic\none. Cholestin, he said, is sold to people who are too healthy for\nMevacor, the Merck drug. Merck, he contends, is making a power grab\nfor that market by trying to push Cholestin off the shelves _ a\ncharge denied by Jan Weiner, a spokeswoman for the pharmaceutical\ncompany.\n", "\n   While the court case is pending, McGlashan said, sales of\nCholestin are booming. One woman recently wrote him to say she had\npurchased eight months' worth of the capsules. Even his mother\ncalled, he said, asking, ``How am I supposed to get my Cholestin?''\n", "\n   For now, McGlashan has no answer. Standing outside the\nlow-pressure room where the encapsulating machine was spinning, a\nlab coat covering his royal blue shirt and Hermes tie, he looked a\nlittle wistful.

Some reefs, however, are proving surprisingly\nresilient, researchers say, not because of qualities of the corals,\nbut because of heat-tolerant algae that live with them.\n", "\nIt may even be possible that heat-related episodes of coral\nbleaching, which had been viewed as ominous previews of mass coral\ndeath to come, could allow these robust algae to spread, leaving\ncorals better able to survive in a warmer world.\n", "\nThe scientists say this strength in the face of warming will not be\nenough to save the world's coral reefs, which are threatened by\npollution, overfishing, tourism and other human activities. But if\nthe findings hold up, \"they essentially buy us time\" to address those\nissues, said Andrew C. Baker of the Marine Program of the Wildlife\nConservation Society, who led the new work.\n", "\nAlgae and corals live in a symbiotic relationship. Coral polyps\nabsorb and shelter the algae, and as the algae photosynthesize they\nproduce sugars that the corals use for energy. But this relationship\ncan falter when ocean water warms, Baker said. \"Basically, algae\ncells are lost from the coral host,\" he said. \"We don't know if it's\nthe algae leaving a sick coral colony or a coral ejecting a defunct\nalgae. I suspect it's a bit of both.\"\n", "\nThe result is coral bereft of much of its power supply. The living\npolyps that give coral reefs their color wither, usually leaving\nlifeless white skeleton reefs of calcium carbonate. It is as if the\nreefs have been bleached.\n", "\nBut the new research, led by Baker, suggests that heat-tolerant algae\nmay move in to replace strains lost in bleaching events. If so, he\nsaid, \"some of the doom and gloom might not be as bad as had been\nsuggested.\"\n", "\nThe findings are \"definitely good news,\" said Nancy Knowlton, an\nexpert on corals who directs the Center for Marine Biodiversity and\nConservation of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the\nUniversity of California, San Diego.\n", "\nBaker and his colleagues studied corals affected by El Nino-Southern\nOscillation events, natural disruptions of ocean currents that occur\nperiodically and that can cause ocean temperatures to rise in one\narea or another. In particular, they studied what happened to corals\nin relatively shallow waters off the Pacific coast of Panama, and in\nthe Indian Ocean off Kenya and Mauritius. All the corals they studied\nwere colonized by Symbiodinium algae, a diverse genus whose various\nspecies look alike but react differently to heat.\n", "\nUsing DNA analysis, they compared the algae populations at those\nthree sites with algae strains in coral reefs in the Persian Gulf,\nwhich are relatively tolerant of heat, and with other corals in the\nRed Sea, where temperatures do not normally rise as high and where\nalgae strains are less heat-tolerant.\n", "\nThe scientists found that reefs in Panama and Kenya, which had\nexperienced unusually high water temperatures, had high proportions\nof a heat-tolerant strain called symbiont D. By contrast, reefs off\nMauritius, where waters remained cooler, had fewer symbiont D algae.\nThey resembled the reefs of the Red Sea, Baker said.\n", "\nBaker said these findings, reported in the journal Nature in August,\nsuggested that when corals lost algae in a bleaching event,\nheat-tolerant algae could move in to replace them. Symbiont D \"is\nbecoming more common on reefs that are experiencing bleaching\nevents,\" Baker said. He said the findings were the first \"real-world\nevidence\" that corals might adapt to warming.\n", "\nBut this kind of adaptation may not be enough \"to let corals off the\nhook,\" as Knowlton of the Scripps Institution put it in an interview.\n", "\nFor example, according to a report issued this month by the Global\nCoral Reef Monitoring Network, scientists do not know exactly what\nconditions must exist for corals to acquire new strains of algae.\nThey do not even know if changes occur when corals recruit different\nalgae from the water around them, or if something somehow changes the\nratio of algae strains growing within them.\n", "\nAlso, Knowlton said, it is not yet known whether corals colonized\nwith new varieties of algae will grow as well as they once did with\nother strains. For example, she said, it could be that heat-tolerant\nalgae strains devote more of their energy to reproducing and less to\nproviding sustenance to their coral hosts. And though symbiont D is\nwidespread among the world's corals, Knowlton said, scientists do not\nknow whether all of them can support the strain.\n", "\nAnswers to those questions await more research, and she said the\nstudy of corals was still developing. \"If it were birds it would be\n18th- or 19th-century science -- who's living with whom, where,\" she\nsaid.\n", "\nHistory suggests that the coral bleaching and mortality associated\nwith the severe El Nino phenomenon of 1997-98 was a thousand-year\nevent, according to the monitoring network's coral report. That\nmeans, in theory, that there is only a 1-in-1,000 chance that similar\neffects would be seen in a given year. But, the report says, evidence\nstrongly suggests that global warming will turn severe bleaching into\n\"a regular event\" by the middle of the century.

Before 1980,\nMount St. Helens had last erupted in 1857.\n", "\nThe pulsations of steam and dust on Friday, described by Major as \"a\nrelatively small burp,\" sent a gray-white plume nearly 10,000 feet\ninto the air. After the eruption, small earthquakes that had been\nrumbling around the volcano for the last week stopped, suggesting\nthat pressures that had been building up had been relieved for now.\nSeismic activity resumed later in the afternoon, Major said, but at a\nquieter level.\n", "\n\"This event is pretty much what we expected and anticipated over the\nlast several days, a relatively small explosion from the lava dome,\"\nMajor said. Scientists cannot say whether the volcano will now calm\ndown or whether more eruptions will occur.\n", "\nAt the time of the eruption, scientists aboard a helicopter were\ntaking measurements using a thermal imager, a device that measures\nheat from a distance. The instrument's readings showed that the site\nof the eruption was not particularly hot, indicating that the\neruption of steam and ash had originated from at least several\nhundred feet underground.\n", "\nThe flow of water out of the crater increased slightly, Major said,\nbut there was no danger of floods or mudslides. Scientists said they\nsaw no signs that would lead them to worry that a larger, dangerous\neruption was imminent.\n", "\n\"There is no indication magma has worked its way up to the surface,\"\nMajor said.\n", "\nThe belch on Friday might have instead been the denouement of some\nunderground indigestion from six years ago.\n", "\nThen, as in the last week, a swarm of small quakes rumbled around the\ndome, a bulge 925 feet high and a half-mile wide at the center of the\ncrater, but then the ground quieted without a new eruption. Analyzing\nthe patterns of shaking, scientists said fresh magma, molten rock,\nhad risen from deep below to the base of the dome, but had not broken\nthrough to the surface.\n", "\nMajor said the working hypothesis was that the eruption on Friday was\nsomehow related to the 1998 events. \"Exactly how it is related is\nstill a matter of speculation,\" he said.\n"], "NYT_ENG_20041003.0147": ["\n", "\nLots of people here remember well how racked with fear they were in\nthe weeks and days leading up to the 1980 eruption of Mount St.\nHelens, the volcano that rained utter havoc from 30 miles away on\nthis tiny town.\n", "\nBut 24 years later, as scientists warn of a new, imminent eruption,\nthe fear has not returned. For one, scientists do not believe the\neruption will be nearly as powerful. But also, residents now know the\ndrill, the evacuation routes and the ways to protect themselves and\ntheir property from heavy ash fall.Residents are slightly nervous but\nmostly aggravated at all the local traffic, caused by the thousands\nof tourists, reporters and entrepreneurs headed through town over the\nlast few days on their way to a lookout point on the mountain.\n", "\nIn 1980, once scientists knew that powerful earthquakes were stirring\nMount St. Helens, few people were visiting the mountain. Now, a spot\nat the Castle Lake Lookout parking lot is a rare commodity. And far\nfrom running away, people like Denise Horton, who lives 130 miles\naway in Sandy, Ore., are traveling hours to get here, bursting with\nanticipation for the eruption.\n", "\n\"It's like waiting for a parade that's late,\" said Horton, who opened\na hot dog stand on the mountain, selling mostly to reporters who were\namong the dozens camped out at the lookout point. \"It's like waiting\nfor a baby.\"\n", "\nThe fact that they are here is testament to the vast forecasting\ngains of scientists, who are armed with new technology and skills\nhoned from the 1980 eruption, which killed 57 people, obliterated 200\nhouses and spawned worldwide interest in the study of volcanoes.\n", "\nSeismometers pinpoint the tiny earthquakes that have been shaking\nMount St. Helens for the past week and a half. Global positioning\nsystem sensors detect outward bulges as slight as a fraction of an\ninch. Instruments aboard a helicopter sniff out gases seeping out of\nthe rocks below and identify hot spots.\n", "\n\"There's really been a revolution,\" said Dr. William E. Scott of the\nU.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver,\nWash., which is monitoring the mountain and holding twice-daily news\nconferences.\n", "\nBut for all their high-tech gadgetry, scientists still do not have a\ndirect way to answer the questions they most want to answer: Where is\nthe molten rock beneath the volcano? And where is it going?\n", "\n\"We don't know where it is,\" said William Steele, a seismologist at\nthe University of Washington.\n", "\nThe expectation is that magma -- underground molten rock -- will\nreach the surface and spill out as lava and that there will be more\neruptions like the small one that happened Friday, or larger.\n", "\n\"Something could happen at any time, basically,\" Scott said at a news\nconference on Sunday afternoon. Or, he said, \"It may stall out and we\nmay never see it.\"\n", "\nThat would disappoint Kathy Teas, who was living nearby in 1980 and\nwas evacuated from her home. Teas later moved to Oregon, but on\nSunday she was back, having spent the previous night at a campsite on\nthe mountain, eager to see an eruption.\n", "\n\"Here I am at 52 and I'm back here again,\" she said. \"To have the\nopportunity to witness this is something I can't pass up.\"\n", "\nFrom the pattern of seismic shakings before and after the 1980\neruption, seismologists laboriously constructed a fuzzy picture of\nthe volcano's workings, the equivalent of a prenatal sonogram. It\nindicated a deep magma chamber about four miles underground and a\nshallower one perhaps a mile below the crater.\n", "\nBut unlike hurricanes, which allow meteorologists to make detailed\nobservations by airplanes and satellites, a volcano eruption develops\nmostly out of sight, hundreds to thousands of feet underground.\n", "\n\"We can't take measurements in the interior,\" said Dr. Anthony Qamar,\na professor of geophysics at the University of Washington.\nInformation like the volcano's internal temperatures and pressures\ncan only be guessed at.\n", "\nInstruments on or hovering above the surface offer only indirect\nsuggestions of what is happening. Volcanologists must sift through\ncompeting plausible explanations for what they observe and what they\ndo not.\n", "\nThus, when a new event occurs, like the continuous, 50-minute,\nlow-frequency tremor on Saturday, the scientists sometimes need to\nquickly revise their thoughts.\n", "\nThe swarms of earthquakes, a few a minute, have been interpreted as\nthe breaking of rocks by the buildup of pressure. The tremor --\naccompanied by a cessation in the earthquakes -- suggested that the\nmagma had broken through and was rising smoothlyleading scientists to\nsuspect an eruption might be imminent.\n", "\nAfter the tremor ended, the earthquakes resumed. At 3 a.m. Sunday, a\nsecond tremor occurred, this time lasting 25 minutes. Again, the\nseismic activity died down, then picked up. Through the day on\nSunday, the intensity of the earthquakes diminished somewhat. \"The\nlarger earthquakes have dropped off,\" Qamar said.\n", "\nThat could mean the pressure had lessened, and the volcano was\nquieting down. Or it could mean that the magma had broken through the\nrock blockage and was now pushing its way toward the surface. Or it\ncould just be a lull.\n", "\n\"We're not interpreting much about that decrease,\" Scott said.\n", "\nWhat has been unusual about the current episode is that all of the\nearthquakes have been shallow, within half a mile or so of the\nsurface. That leaves scientists wondering whether magma is rising\nfrom the deep chamber or whether the magma driving the tremors and\neruptions is left over from six years ago. Then, as now, a swarm of\nearthquakes shook the area, and scientists believe that magma rose\nupward beneath the crater, although nothing broke through as an\neruption.\n", "\nWhether the magma is new or old is important, because that could\ndetermine whether the eruptions will explosively shoot clouds of ash\nthat spread over a large area or, less catastrophically, just push\nout lava.\n", "\n\"The analogy is the old Coke can that you shake up and open,\" Scott\nsaid. \"If you shake it a whole lot and pop it open, you're going to\nget a lot of frothing and it's going to be an explosive event. But if\nyou pour it in a glass and let the gas come out and then you try to\nshake the glass, you can't get as much fizz.\"\n", "\nOnce scientists realized this weekend that an eruption could be\nimminent, spectators were ordered to leave an observatory five miles\nfrom the crater. But lookout points farther away were not considered\nto be in danger.\n", "\nHere in Toutle (pronounced TOOT-el), a town of 700 that is the\nclosest to the mountain, many residents said that while they were not\npanicking, they were concerned about an eruption causing a mudflow\ninto the three nearby rivers, which were flooded and full of floating\ndebris in 1980.\n", "\n\"All I can say is you better learn to respect it,\" Karen Meyers, 43,\nwho lives in Toutle and witnessed the 1980 eruption. \"I mean, last\ntime, their worst-case scenario didn't even come close to what\nhappened here.

When a hospital\npsychiatrist recommended that her daughter go to an acute-care center\nfor treatment, Montaner discovered that Texas had no such facility\ndedicated to eating disorders.\n", "\nShe found one in Arizona, but it cost thousands of dollars per week\nfor a mandatory 60-day stay and would not accept her daughter without\n$25,000 up front. Montaner, her husband and her ex-husband, Amanda's\nfather, all had health insurance, but the three plans together didn't\ncome close to covering the cost of treatment.\n", "\nShe settled for a facility in Florida that the family could afford.\nDuring her daughter's 45-day stay, Montaner's anger turned to action.\n", "\n\"You didn't hear anything about it in schools. You heard about safe\nsex, drugs, AIDS ... but you never heard anything about eating\ndisorders. That's when I decided to start Lifelines.\"\n", "\nMontaner established the nonprofit Lifelines Foundation for Eating\nDisorders with the goal of establishing the first acute-care facility\nin Texas dedicated solely to treating eating disorders. She plans on\ncalling it \"The Haven.\" She has written hundreds of letters,\nincluding one to first lady Laura Bush that led to Montaner's being\nappointed to the adolescent health committee for the Texas Department\nof Health.\n", "\nWhen word about Amanda's ordeal got around her school, five of her\nclassmates who also had eating disorders came forward, Montaner said.\nUsing grant money to help with expenses, Montaner began traveling the\nstate, speaking at other schools about eating disorders.\n", "\n\"I have heard one resounding theme,\" she said. \"School nurses and\ncounselors don't have the information needed when a student, teacher,\ncoach or family member comes to them for help.\"\n", "\nMontaner decided to do something about it. With an anonymous $64,000\ndonation, she had enough educational materials published to send to\nall 20 Education Service Centers in Texas. But for now, the materials\nare sitting on the same 11 pallets they were shipped to her on.\nMontaner is trying to raise the estimated $40,000 needed to get the\nitems distributed.\n", "\nHeidi Strickler, an eating disorder specialist at Providence\nHealthcare Network's DePaul Center who arrived after Montaner started\nLifelines, helped write the materials.\n", "\n\"I'm the only specialist in the area,\" Strickler said. \"Not many\ntherapists want to deal with it because eating disorders have the\nhighest mortality rate of any mental illness, and the patients are\nextremely difficult to work with.\"\n", "\nThe materials include handouts, posters and booklets with information\non the disease, how to get help and, most importantly, Montaner said,\ncontact information on each piece.\n", "\n\"The materials are designed to be available to the kids so that they\ncan pick one up and they don't have to talk to anybody,\" she said.\n\"They don't have to ask anybody for anything. They can pick one up\nand take it home.\"\n", "\nAccording to the NEDA, 80 percent of adolescent girls feel bad about\ntheir bodies, and 28 percent of boys are dissatisfied with their\nweight. Poor body image dating back to a swim meet Amanda won when\nshe was 7 led to her battle with eating disorders, Montaner said.\n", "\n\"She climbed out of the pool, and some kid standing nearby said,\n'Gee, I didn't know Shamu was swimming today,' \" Montaner said.\n\"There was also an incident not long after that when she was in choir\nand someone told her she should be wearing a tent rather than a robe.\nAll those kinds of memories came out in therapy years later.\"\n", "\nOther battles Montaner has waged include seeking a change in state\nlegislation that would force insurance companies to pay for treatment\nof eating disorders. So far the insurance lobby has blocked attempts\nto have anorexia and bulimia added to the list of serious mental\nillnesses that insurance companies are mandated to cover, which\nincludes schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n", "\nIn the meantime, people like Amanda will continue the daily struggle\nto keep their disorder in check.

Because no laboratory tests or other\nobjective criteria exist for making psychiatric diagnoses, the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association's manual is the definitive arbiter\nof the line between normal and abnormal. Its definitions help\ndetermine such practical matters as insurance reimbursement,\ncompetence and eligibility for disability. But they also help\ndetermine something more elusive, and probably more important:\nwhether someone's behavior should be considered a personality quirk\nor a symptom of mental illness.\n", "\nNow, in the diagnostic category of eating disorders, the search for\ngreater specificity in the Not Otherwise Specified grab bag is\ngenerating much attention.\n", "\n\"The Future of EDNOS\" was a topic at an international meeting on\neating disorders in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, last month, and it is\nthe title of a book expected to be released in Europe next year.\n", "\nTo some observers, this new attention comes not a moment too soon.\n", "\n\"EDNOS right now is a real hodgepodge,\" said Dr. B. Timothy Walsh,\nprofessor of pediatric psychopharmacology at Columbia. \"We have\npeople in that category with anorexia nervosa,\" but they still\nmenstruate so they don't meet all the criteria for a formal\ndiagnosis.\n", "\nSimilarly, Walsh said, \"we have people who are obese and binge but\ndon't vomit,\" so they don't fit into the strict definition of bulimia\nnervosa, which requires both binging and purging. Or they might binge\nand vomit once a week, but to qualify as bulimic they would have to\nvomit at least twice a week.\n", "\n\"What we really need to do is collect data,\" Walsh said. \"All the\nknowledge base we currently have relates to people who vomit twice a\nweek. But if it turns out that the characteristics of those who binge\nand vomit once a week are similar to those who do so twice a week,\nthen we can loosen the criteria for bulimia nervosa.\"\n", "\nThe history of eating disorders has been a gradual one as the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual has been revised through the years.\nAnorexia nervosa first appeared in the version of the manual\npublished in 1980, and bulimia appeared for the first time in the\nsame edition. Bulimia was renamed bulimia nervosa in the next\nedition, which came out in 1987.\n", "\nAnorexia nervosa affects 0.5 to 3.7 percent -- or about 1.5 million\nto 11 million American women -- at some point in life, according to\nthe National Institute of Mental Health. Rates are lower among men\nand teenage boys.\n", "\nThe lifetime prevalence of bulimia is higher -- from 1.1 to 4.2\npercent of women -- with a similar age and sex distribution.\n", "\nIn the current version of the diagnostic manual, published in 1994,\none condition -- binge eating disorder -- was pulled out of EDNOS and\nlisted as a \"provisional diagnostic category,\" the first step in the\nprocess of achieving its own diagnosis. The disorder is much like\nbulimia nervosa, but without the purging.\n", "\nThe \"provisional\" designation highlights the need for more research\ninto a condition's prevalence and treatment, and highlighting binge\neating disorder in this way was a prelude to its being named as a\nseparate diagnosis in the manual that is to appear in 2012.\n", "\n\"That's one of most compelling reasons to get something out of the\nNot Otherwise Specified category,\" said Dr. Michael First, associate\nprofessor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia. First is a member of\nthe planning group that is directing the enormous undertaking of\nrevising the manual for its fifth edition.\n", "\n\"If you feel that there's a homogeneous group of patients in there\nfor which there's a treatment, the fact that it's called Not\nOtherwise Specified really obscures it, hindering treatment,\nhindering research,\" he said.\n", "\nAnother candidate for a new eating disorder in the fifth edition of\nthe manual can be thought of as the flip side of binge eating, a\ncondition that has been labeled \"purging disorder\" by Dr. Pamela\nKeel, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Iowa.\nJust as binge eating disorder has many of the characteristics of\nbulimia, so does purging disorder. But neither meets the strict\ncriteria for bulimia nervosa.\n", "\nPeople with purging disorder, Keel said, are of normal weight, and\nthey purge after eating normal or even small amounts of food.\n", "\nRight now, purging disorder is relatively hidden, buried in the EDNOS\ncategory. And until the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual panelists\nask for more data, as they have for binge eating disorder, not much\nmore will be known, Keel said.\n", "\n\"Within widely used diagnostic interviews, if a person has never had\na low weight and denies a history of binge eating, the interviewer\nskips all questions regarding the use of vomiting, laxatives or\ndiuretics to control weight,\" Keel wrote in an e-mail message. \"It's\nvery difficult to learn more about a problem if you never ask any\nquestions about it.\"\n", "\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n", "\nAs First sees it, several criteria must be met before a diagnosis is\npulled out of the Not Otherwise Specified category and into a\nstand-alone diagnosis. These criteria have to be met before binge\neating disorder, purging disorder or any other condition emerges out\nof the EDNOS grab bag.\n", "\nThe first requirement is that a significant number of patients must\nbe affected, he said. Second, there has to be evidence of an existing\nand effective treatment.\n", "\nThe criterion of an effective treatment has prevented many conditions\nfrom being entered in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. In the\n1980s, there was an effort to include \"sadistic personality\ndisorder.\" But it failed, said First, because no treatment existed.\n\"We could have decided to call something sadistic personality\ndisorder,\" he said, \"but if there's no treatment, what would be the\npoint?\"\n", "\nThe third criterion for removing a condition from the Not Otherwise\nSpecified category is the trickiest to meet. It relates to a kind of\ndiagnosis-creep. Experts working on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\npanels must ask how close the condition is to behavior that could be\nconsidered normal. For binge eating disorder, for instance, they must\nask: When is such behavior a true psychiatric condition, and when is\nit the kind of thing that almost everyone engages in every\nThanksgiving?\n", "\n\"This is the matter of what we call false positives,\" First said.\n\"It's the danger of defining as a psychiatric syndrome a set of\nsymptoms that normal people have.\"\n", "\nWhen a new category is created in the manual, he said, \"you're trying\nto identify a category that will help patients get treatment.\"\n", "\n\"But,\" he continued, \"you're worried that this category is going to\nbe applied to normal people as well.\"\n", "\nSome psychiatrists want to create a different label for EDNOS,\ncalling it instead \"mixed eating disorder\" or \"atypical eating\ndisorder.\" But Walsh of Columbia said that would be merely a cosmetic\nchange.\n", "\n\"If I'm a clinician and I get a call from a school saying, 'Hey, I've\ngot a person with mixed eating disorder coming over,' I don't know if\nI'm going to be seeing someone who weighs 80 pounds or 280 pounds,\"\nhe said. \"The whole belief that diagnoses are useful things rests on\ntheir ability to put together under one umbrella a relatively\nhomogeneous set of syndromes, which gives the clinician the ability\nto shortcut a full assessment.\"\n", "\nDiagnostic labels, said Walsh, \"allow big shortcuts.\"\n", "\nKeel, on the other hand, prefers the term \"mixed eating disorder\"\nover EDNOS. She said the mixed eating disorder label \"may have the\nbenefit of eliminating the false impression that EDNOS is somehow\nless severe or less clinically significant than so-called\nfull-threshold eating disorders.\" But she expressed concern that the\nterm would limit the enthusiasm for teasing out what other\nidentifiable conditions lie within the EDNOS category.\n", "\nAs experts debate what to do about EDNOS -- pull out distinct\ndisorders from the grab bag category, change the diagnostic criteria\nfor the existing disorder, give the grab bag a more\nscientific-sounding name -- people with disordered eating are left in\na kind of therapeutic limbo.\n", "\nEventually, the hope is, the uncertainties will be resolved, and the\nwoman with anorexia who still menstruates and the woman with bulimia\nwho only purges once a week, will be able to get the diagnosis and\ntreatment that they need.\n"], "AFP_ENG_20050112.0350": ["\n", "\nWith her white chef's hat, Claudia looks \nat home in the kitchen of this Berlin restaurant, but her culinary \ntalents are being used to feed people who, like her, suffer from \neating disorders.\n", "\nThe owner of \"Sehnsucht\", or Nostalgia, in the German capital's \nTiergarten quarter is Katja Eichbaum, and she too has come a long \nway back from the brink.\n", "\nHer appetite began to disappear when her parents split up while \nshe was a teenager.

But it\nis a big risk to people 75 and older, people with compromised\nimmune systems, pregnant women and the very young. Pregnant women\nand their unborn children are in the greatest danger.

(The company is now defunct.) There were also 30\nstillbirths and deaths of newborns. Another 142 people became ill.\n", "\n   Listeria is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily\ncome in contact with dairy products, uncooked meats, fish, poultry\nand vegetables as well as precooked meats like the ones responsible\nfor the August outbreak. The investigators say they do not know how\nthe listeria contaminated the cooked meats at Bil Mar Foods.\n", "\n   Food-borne diseases like listeriosis are more troubling today\nfor several reasons, including changes in the makeup of the\npopulation and the increasingly complex way food is processed and\ndistributed. The population is aging: In 1950, 2.6 percent of\nAmericans were over 74; by 1995, the percentage was 5.6. The number\nof people who survive cancer for five years has also increased, as\nhas the number of people who have AIDS or are living with\ntransplanted organs.\n", "\n   In addition, the centralization of food production has turned\nwhat might previously have been a small local problem into a global\none. Products from the Bil Mar plant, for example, are distributed\nall over the United States.\n", "\n   Still, Dr. Michael Osterholm, the state epidemiologist at the\nMinnesota Health Department, says he is increasingly frustrated\nwith the federal government's response to outbreaks of food\npoisoning, and even with the new detection system.\n", "\n   In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the\nannouncement of the recall to the company. The agency does not\nannounce recalls until it has proof that a sealed product contains\nthe disease-causing bacteria, and it did not have that proof until\nDec. 31, nine days later.\n", "\n   When the company announced the recall, a spokesman for the\nAgriculture Department, Andrew Solomon, said, reporters who cover\nthe agency were notified and the information was put on the\nagency's Web site and on its consumer-information line\n(800-535-4555).\n", "\n   ``We felt the word was out there and an additional press release\nwould not have generated new news coverage,'' he said.\n", "\n   Osterholm disagrees. ``If there had been a real effort to get\nthe message out by the Department of Agriculture throughout the\ncountry, consumers would have had more awareness,'' he said.\n", "\n   Both he and Dale Morris, the director of the division of\ninfectious disease of the New York State Health Department, say\nthere can never be enough notification.

They also say\nthat it is essential to cook hot dogs until the internal\ntemperature reaches 165 degrees, by either steaming or frying.\nCooking in the microwave is not recommended.

In\naddition, in 2003 and earlier this year, they found that more people\nin the Vioxx group were having cardiovascular events than in the\nplacebo group. The numbers were small, in part because people with\nheart disease had been screened out of the trial, but the trend had\nbeen worrisome and the latest data were striking: After 18 months on\nthe drug, the Vioxx group was clearly having more heart problems than\nthe placebo group and the rate of difference was accelerating.\n", "\n``When I saw the last set of data, I knew we had a tough decision\nto make,'' said James Neaton, a University of Minnesota\nbiostatistician, who had monitored a dozen other studies but seldom\nhad seen such troubling data. ``There was so much at stake for\neveryone involved. ... You have to have data that the scientific\ncommunity will accept.''\n", "\nNeaton and the three safety committee members spent several days\nstudying the data, then held their regularly scheduled phone\nconference Sept. 17. They talked first with Merck representatives and\nthe principal investigator for the colon polyp trial, John Baron of\nDartmouth Medical School.\n", "\nThen Baron and the Merck people left the call, freeing the four\nsafety panel members to talk openly about the latest unsettling data.\nThe experts agreed unanimously that the trial had to stop.\n", "\n``Coming to that conclusion, it took our breath way,'' Neaton said.\nVioxx was Merck's fourth top seller, and they knew their decision\nwould be extremely harmful to the company.\n", "\nNeaton immediately called Baron, who was conducting the trial with\na grant from Merck, and explained the problem.\n", "\nWhen Neaton faxed him the ``unblinded'' data, the signal was clear:\nWithin the small population of people suffering from cardiovascular\ndisease, the number from the Vioxx group after 18 months of study was\ntwice as high as the placebo group -- 15 heart attacks or strokes per\n1,000 patients per year, versus 7.5 for the sugar pill. ``I looked at\nit and concurred immediately that the trial should stop,'' Baron said.\nBut first, Baron needed to get the approval of his steering committee\nof others involved in the trial. This took nearly a week, during which\nBaron took precautions to guard against leaks of negative information\nand insider trading of Merck shares.\n", "\nOn Sept. 23 the full committee agreed to halt the trial. That\nafternoon, Baron called his contact at Merck to say that the drug\npresented an unacceptable risk of cardiovascular damage.\n", "\nBaron said in the next few days, as he presented the data to\ncompany officials and some outside Merck advisers, he experienced ``no\npushback at all.'' But then again, he said, ``if an independent\ncommittee makes a recommendation like ours, only a fool would tell us\nto buzz off.''\n", "\nMerck lab director Kim heard the news on when he dialed into his\nvoice mail while driving to work, 7:30 a.m. on Sept. 24.\n", "\n``I was stunned,'' said Kim who had expected positive results. He\nand other Merck scientists pored over the data, looking for flaws but\nfinding none. At midday, Kim got the general counsel Frazier on the\nline and called Raymond Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and\nchief executive.\n", "\n``The drug held up for three years. When you've been going this\nlong you don't expect this kind of phone call,'' Gilmartin remembered\nin an interview soon after the drug was pulled.\n", "\nMerck critics, and there are many, say the company had plenty of\nwarning. Yet Merck continued advertising.\n", "\n``There was so much denial over there,'' said David Moskowitz,\nsenior pharmaceutical analyst for Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Co.\n", "\nLast week, Gilmartin and Kim still said that none of the earlier\nVioxx studies, by either the company or others, convincingly showed\nincreased heart and stroke risk from the drug. As a result, they said,\nthere was no reason to stop the advertising campaign.\n", "\n``We were acting totally consistent with the data we had,''\nGilmartin said. ``We undertook right away to ask the right\nquestions.'' The company was trying to get at cardiovascular risk, he\nsaid, by initiating three clinical trials that would together give\nimportant new information on the issue. Many doctors and patients\nliked Vioxx's track record on gastrointestinal problems, a major\nsource of worry for arthritis patients.\n", "\nBut, on the phone call, when Kim delivered the new, more damaging\nresults, Gilmartin's choices were bleak. Even if the painkiller stayed\non the market, sales would almost certainly plummet because its\nadvertising would be restricted and would have to carry a ``black\nbox'' warning about the heart attack risks.\n", "\nGilmartin was clear that the trial should be halted and that the\ndrug might have to be taken off the market. ``Look Peter, we're going\nto make this decision based on what's in the best interest of science\nand patient safety,'' Gilmartin recalled saying. ``It's not that we're\nunaware of the consequences, but it's a deep-seated belief that if you\ndo the right thing, rewards will follow,'' he said of the decision to\npull the drug.\n", "\nThe decision was also sound litigation strategy. The company was\nalready facing two class action lawsuits alleging patient harm from\nVioxx. Anything that smacked of a cover-up would have strengthened the\nplaintiffs' hands.\n", "\n``Running away from your problems, denial, is the worst possible\nchoice,'' said Anthony Sabino, professor of business law at St. John's\nUniversity.\n", "\nOver the next three days, Kim and his researchers convened three\nteleconferences with about 15 outside medical experts to get their\nadvice. By then, Kim said, he was leaning toward pulling the drug. But\nthe outside experts, most of whom had done previous work with Merck\nand were offered a fee for their consultation, had surprisingly mixed\nopinions.\n", "\nA sizable group were reluctant to give up a painkiller proven to\nhave fewer gastrointestinal side effects than others and were not\nconvinced the available alternatives were any safer, participants\nsaid. (On Friday, Pfizer Inc. issued a warning that its Cox-2 drug\nBextra may increase cardiovascular risk for some patients.) Duke\nUniversity cardiologist Robert Califf argued strenuously on one\nteleconference for keeping the drug on the market with a much stronger\nwarning label. He had been railing publicly for some time about the\nabsence of long-term cardiovascular risk studies on painkillers, a\nsituation that he said made selecting the right drug a ``total\ncrapshoot.''\n", "\nIn his view, the new Vioxx data quantified the risk and made it\nmanageable. ``The curves show not even a hint of a detrimental effect\nfor 18 months,'' and even after that the risks did not appear that\nlarge. ``I thought the risk was going to be larger than it was,'' he\nsaid.\n", "\nBut Northwestern University rheumatologist Thomas Schnitzer argued\nfor ditching Vioxx entirely because Merck's scientists could not\nexplain why the drug started causing heart attacks after 18 months.\nFurthermore, Merck's carefully cultivated image would go out the\nwindow if Vioxx stayed on the market, he said, because Merck ``prides\nitself on its ethical approach. I couldn't see Merck saying we're\ngoing to market a drug with a safety problem.''\n", "\nAt lunchtime on Monday, Sept. 27, it was time to make a final\ndecision. Kim, Frazier and Gilmartin gathered in the chief executive's\nconference room at the Whitehouse Station, N.J., campus. The lab\ndirector's message came in two parts: the experts were divided over\nwhether Merck had to pull Vioxx off the market, but Kim thought they\nshould do it anyway.\n", "\nGilmartin said he agreed the drug should be pulled but wanted to\ntake a decision of that magnitude to his board of directors who\nconcurred when they met the next day. By then, Merck had notified the\nFDA that it needed an emergency meeting that afternoon, and asked that\ntop officials be present.\n", "\nIn the meeting, top FDA officials were shown preliminary slides\nfrom the colon polyp study and were told by Merck that the drug would\nbe withdrawn. The FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research director\nSteven Galson said there was discussion of keeping the drug for\nshort-term use, but the company did not think it was practical.\n", "\nFearful of a leak, Merck officials waited until the next day,\nWednesday, to tell international affiliates of the planned withdrawal\nand asked them to hold off on telling their regulators until the news\nwas made public. Three Merck officials sat up all night Wednesday\nanswering e-mails and phone calls from the foreign medical directors.\n", "\nWithdrawal day started early, with a 4 a.m. e-mail to Merck's\n60,000 employees alerting them to a major announcement. At 9 a.m. on\nSept. 30, Gilmartin and Kim took the stage at the Hilton Times Square\nand faced a room packed with reporters and television cameras.\n", "\n``This morning Merck is announcing a voluntary worldwide withdrawal\nof Vioxx,'' Gilmartin began.\n", "\nSince the Merck decision, public health advocates and some\ncongressional leaders have asked pointedly why the FDA, the nation's\narbiter of drug safety, did not act sooner itself. Galson said that\nhis agency met often with Merck to discuss earlier troubling Vioxx\nstudies, and said that ``we insisted that we needed more information\nabout the cardiovascular risks.'' In 2001, the agency formally warned\nthe company against misleading doctors about those risks, and in 2002,\nthe FDA required stiffer wording on the drug label.\n", "\nNonetheless, the agency had agreed with Merck that the 2000 study\nhad too many confounding aspects to be definitive. The national\nadverse event reporting system that helps the FDA flag dangerous side\neffects was of little use in this case because the ailments possibly\ncaused by Vioxx -- heart attacks and strokes -- are so common.\n", "\nGalson also said that Vioxx safety follow-up was complicated by the\nfact that it is unethical to give placebos to arthritic patients,\nbecause their pain needs treatment. Instead the FDA strongly supported\nthe Merck decision to use three placebo-controlled trials in healthy\npeople to test whether the drug was protective against prostate and\ncolon cancer and colon polyps and also to study cardiovascular risk.\n", "\nThe FDA's own study of the Vioxx safety issue has become mired in\ncontroversy. The FDA safety officer in charge of the report, David\nGraham, concluded that Vioxx posed much greater cardiovascular risk\nthan the other major drug in its class, Celebrex. He presented that\ninformation at a French conference this summer. Galson has said,\nhowever, that he only saw a short abstract of the study and so could\nnot act on its conclusions, a contention that Graham disputes.\n", "\nThe controversy grew Friday when Grassley asked Merck, among other\nthings, about an e-mail provided by Graham in which a Merck official\ncomplained that the FDA had not lived up to a prior agreement to alert\nthe company before releasing any negative information about its\nproducts.\n", "\nThe FDA's opportunity to act independently on Vioxx ended on Sept.\n27, when the fax came from Merck asking for an urgent meeting with\nsenior officials. The next day surprised FDA officials learned the\ndrug would be pulled.\n", "\nDespite the criticism directed at his agency, Galson remains\nunapologetic. ``We did the right things based on what we knew at the\ntime,'' he said. But taking the drug off the market, he said, was the\nright thing, too.\n"], "LTW_ENG_20041014.0021": ["\n", "\nThe following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post:\n", "\nIn a certain sense, Merck & Co.'s decision to cease selling Vioxx,\nits best-selling painkiller, demonstrates how the peculiarly American\ncombination of government regulation and private-sector competition\ncan, serendipitously, sometimes work well. Vioxx was approved after\ntrials held under the auspices of the Food and Drug Administration\nshowed it to be effective (which it was). After some initial evidence\nthat the drug might be linked to cardiac disease, the FDA required\nMerck to attach an additional warning (which was justified). Merck,\nwhich knew Vioxx was in competition with similar drugs, then conducted\nfurther trials, largely to find out if Vioxx could be legitimately\nrecommended for other conditions. Through this process, Merck\ndiscovered that Vioxx did indeed carry a small but unacceptable risk\nof cardiac problems when used for longer than 18 months. Competition\ncombined with regulation forced the drug off the market. And if courts\ndetermine that Merck was negligent, the company will pay a heavy price\nin compensation.\n", "\nOn its own, this incident does not make a good argument for more\nstringent FDA approval procedures. Extensive and lengthy pre-approval\ntesting of the sort that would have kept Vioxx -- and all other drugs --\nunder examination for years ultimately would have harmed more patients\nthan it would have helped. As hundreds of patients' groups can attest,\nthere are high costs when the FDA does not approve drugs quickly, even\ndrugs with serious side effects. People die every day waiting for new\ntreatments.\n", "\nBut the Vioxx withdrawal should inspire some sharper thought about\nwhat happens to drugs once they have been approved, and whether the\nFDA should have the authority to mandate more thorough, ongoing,\nlong-term testing. This is a safety issue, but also an economic one.\nVioxx is a new-generation painkiller, one of several that are (or\nwere) prescribed instead of aspirin or other over-the-counter drugs.\nVioxx was easier on the stomach than aspirin, but it cost more. Did\nthe 20 million Americans who used the drug since its launch in 1999\nreally have to spend that extra money and, as it turns out, incur a\nslight extra risk? Or were they persuaded to do so by Merck's\nadvertising?\n", "\nAccording to studies carried out by the Kaiser Family Foundation\nand others, the pharmaceutical industry's advertising encourages some\npeople to consult doctors, which is a good thing, particularly for\nthose who may not have known they have, say, high cholesterol or blood\npressure. But ads also persuade people to spend money on unnecessary\ndrugs, which is a bad thing for their health and for insurance\npremiums. The solution is not a total ban on advertising, as some\nsuggest, but rather more clinical trials of drugs, aimed specifically\nat determining effectiveness as well as long-term safety. It is in the\ninsurance industry's interest, the FDA's interest and the federal\ngovernment's interest -- because the federal government is a major\nprovider of health insurance -- either to require drug companies to\nconduct such comparative tests or to set up a neutral agency to do so.\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from the Vioxx withdrawal, surely\nit is the need for renewed attention to evidence-based medicine and\nevidence-based drug prescription as well.\n"], "APW_ENG_20041008.0053": ["\n", "\nThe Food and Drug Administration silenced one of its drug experts who\nraised safety concerns weeks before Merck & Co. yanked the\nblockbuster drug Vioxx due to increased risks for heart attack and\nstrokes, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee said Thursday.\n", "\nDr. David J.
