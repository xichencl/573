months,'' and even after that the risks did not appear that large.", "``I thought the risk was going to be larger than it was,'' he said.", " But Northwestern University rheumatologist Thomas

discuss earlier troubling Vioxx studies, and said that ``we insisted that we needed more information about the cardiovascular risks.''", "In 2001, the agency formally warned the company against misleading doctors about those risks, and in 2002, the FDA required stiffer wording on the drug label.", " Nonetheless, the agency had agreed with Merck that the 2000 study had too many confounding aspects to be definitive.", "The national adverse event reporting system that helps the FDA flag dangerous side effects was of little use in this case because the ailments possibly caused by Vioxx -- heart attacks and strokes -- are so common.", " Galson also said that Vioxx safety follow-up was complicated by the fact that it is unethical to give placebos to arthritic patients, because their pain needs treatment.", "Instead the FDA strongly supported the Merck decision to use three placebo-controlled trials in healthy people to test whether the drug was protective against prostate and colon cancer and colon polyps and also to study cardiovascular risk.", " The FDA's own study of the Vioxx safety issue has become mired in controversy.", "The FDA safety officer in charge of the report,
