", " Some people said the Government had made the problem worse with inadequate enforcement; some said that the copyright industry, in particular the audio visual sector, should review the quality and pricing of their products; some even said the considerable profits of the pirates would lure the unemployed into the illicit trade. ", " I was asked at a press conference on 1 May whether \"the Government was trying to shift its responsibilities in fight copyright piracy onto ordinary citizens\"; and that \"cheaper, pirated goods were the natural choices for less well-paid people during a economic down-turn\". ", " I regret to see such dis-respect about intellectual property rights. ", " There are people who buy and knowingly use pirated movies or computer software without feeling any sense of guilt, sometimes even bragging about the act. ", " This is not how a responsible and righteous man will behave, nor an act we should see in a healthy society. ", " Both the Government and the right owners have a role in combating copyright piracy, but it is also important that they have the support of the masses. ", " Intellectual property rights are intangible, private rights; they should be respected and protected by law like physical property rights before we could encourage new inventions, or cultivate creative work in the audio-visual fields. ", " These private property rights are the foundations of Hong Kong's prosperity. ", " Copyright pirates will jeopardize our business and creative environment, making it unsafe for new products and the life blood of inventors, and damage Hong Kong's hard-won reputation as a major business and financial centre. ", " It is the public who suffers when our economy suffers. ", " Let me take the film industry as an example. ", " While copyright piracy is not the sole reason behind the decline of our film industry, the pirates have nonetheless dealt it a severe blow. ", " Making movies will need millions in capital; the proper return of investment is of course an issue for consideration, so are the efforts of all those behind and in front of the camera. ", " The viewers should understand that the copyright pirates are hijacking all these efforts. ", " According to estimates of the film industry, the pirates accounted for a 30% decrease in box offices, or approximately $300 million. ", " The losses rose to $1 billion if overseas distribution was also included. ", " Since the profits of the pirates do not go back to the movie companies, the decrease in return and increase in risk are putting off investors. ", " This is adversely affecting the livelihood of those working for movies and indirectly suffocating the development of the industry. ", " Hong Kong produced more than 200 movies a year in its hey day, mesmerizing viewers in southeast Asia. ", " We will not want to see a drain of our talents from Hong Kong and the fall of the \"Eastern Hollywood\". ", " For the same reason, pirated compact discs hit the music industry badly, stripping the creators and performers of their deserved return, hindering creativity and affecting the livelihood of people in the industry (including the artists). ", " We should realise that good creations and artists can only come from a healthy music industry. ", " The real way to support your idols is to walk away from pirated copies. ", " Another cornerstone of Hong Kong's prosperity is the rule of law. ", " All civil and criminal action can only proceed under the law. ", " The Government has in the past year greatly strengthened the laws protecting intellectual property rights. ", " For example, Customs' capabilities to enforce against copyright piracy were enhanced under the Copyright Ordinance enacted in June 1997. ", " The maximum penalty for possessing for trade or business purposes pirated articles is imprisonment of 4 years and a fine of $50 000 per infringing article. ", " The maximum penalty for manufacturing pirated articles is imprisonment of 8 years and a fine of $500 000. ", " I am glad that the courts are handing down heavier sentences for copyright offences. ", " This shows the judiciary understands the evil that copyright piracy is doing against Hong Kong. ", " I hope to see more heavier sentences as a deterrent. ", " The effectiveness of the protection for intellectual property hinges on the law and the enforcement. ", " This is why we see so much in vigorous enforcement action. ", " We are glad that at the retail level, copyright piracy at some notorious blackspots have subsided under raids by Customs. ", " Although the mobility of the pirates and the demand for pirated goods have added to our enforcement difficulties, Customs will continue to raid other blackspots, and where necessary, join hands with the Police and other Government departments in their enforcement action. ", " Apart from the retail level, we also target copyright piracy at source. ", " Since last December, licences are required for the import and export of optical disc manufacturing equipment. ", " This will enable Customs to better trace the movements of such equipment, preventing their being used illegitimately. ", " The Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance, enacted in March, further requires all optical disc manufacturers to be licensed by Customs, and adds a mandatory requirement for all optical discs manufactured in Hong Kong to bear a permanent source identification code. ", " This allows Customs to effectively monitor the optical disc manufacturing industry and guard against piracy. ", " I have signed the commencement notice for the Ordinance, and it has already come into operation on 29 May. ", " The optical disc manufacturers will have a grace period of three months to apply for licences and comply with the source identification coding requirement. ", " I hope you are beginning to understand that not only the Customs or the right owners, but cooperation of all is required to effectively protect intellectual property rights and to combat copyright piracy or trade mark counterfeiting. ", " Some may ask if the Government could enact more severe laws to punish the pirates and introduce a deterrent. ", " It is imperative that a responsible Government should carefully consider every possible solution to a problem. ", " We are now considering whether to introduce new provisions in addition to the existing legal framework. ", " For example, legal liabilities for buyers of pirated products or confiscating criminal proceeds of the pirates are two proposals under our scrutiny. ", " I have to emphasize that we have not reached any conclusions in respect of any proposals and we will not take any moves lightly. ", " I can assure you that every aspect will be examined in detail, and we will also consult the public and the copyright industry. ", " However, we should now concentrate on effectively implementing our existing law. ", " We all know that we could not litigate or prosecute for each and every ailment . ", " In any advanced society, a high level of civic education will engender respect for other people. ", " Education is the ultimate solution to copyright piracy. ", " While education is a long-term effort, we have already taken our first steps, in collaboration with the copyright industry, and started explaining to students the importance of protecting intellectual property rights. ", " Intellectual property rights are the pillars of the economy in the 21st century and the rule of the game in international trade. ", " New products and services are the hot commodities of the international market; the continued growth and development of Hong Kong depend on continued improvement and development of high value-added items. ", " The fruits of such creativity will in turn depend on the cooperation of the Government, the authors and creators, and our fellow citizens. ", " Copyright piracy destroys Hong Kong's creative edge, we must be determined in our fight against piracy in order to protect Hong Kong's international trading reputation and business environment. ", " The first thing we could do to eliminate piracy is to walk away from pirated products.

", " Meeting the challenge of piracy and counterfeiting will remain high on the agenda of many Asian governments. ", " I am therefore especially grateful for this opportunity to share with you Hong Kong's experience in dealing with the complex subject of protecting intellectual property rights. ", " The Importance of Intellectual Property Rights Protection ", " Within the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, policy responsibility for intellectual property rights protection falls within my portfolio as the Secretary for Trade and Industry. ", " This is a reflection of our recognition of the fact that intellectual property rights protection is an essential element in the development of trade, investment and technology transfer. ", " We have for long recognised that it is very much in Hong Kong's own interest to protect intellectual property rights. ", " And we do not have to look far for the reasons. ", " Much of our economy depends on the creativity of our people. ", " Whether we are talking about fashion, toys, watches or jewellery, which together account for a large chunk of our exports, much of the value added has come from the design of the products. ", " We are also one of the largest exporters of cinema films in the world. ", " I can go on to list other examples. ", " But the underlying message should be abundantly clear. ", " Our economic well-being depends on the brain power of our people. ", " Attempts to steal the intellectual property attaching to the products and services of our legitimate businesses amount to attempts to undermine our economic viability. ", " Hong Kong is also an excellent destination for foreign investment. ", " Our attractions are manifold. ", " Among those most commonly cited are our superb physical infrastructure, our simple tax regime and low tax rates, our well developed financial support services and regulatory system, the rule of law and in general a very business-friendly environment. ", " There are of course many ingredients in a business-friendly environment, but many internationally renowned surveys count the existence of a reliable system for the effective protection of intellectual property rights as an integral part of such an environment. ", " This is natural. ", " Investors need peace of mind about the protection of their legitimate interests. ", " They will be deterred if they are worried that their orders will be over-produced for channeling to the illegal market or that their inventions will be copied without authorization. ", " For us to sustain and sharpen our attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment and reap the benefits of technology upgrading and wealth creation, intellectual property protection is not a luxury, but a must. ", " Another relevant consideration in this equation is the future of our economic development. ", " Over the past two decades, Hong Kong has undergone a restructuring of its economy. ", " Many of the more labour and land intensive assembly processes have been relocated to our hinterland in Southern China, or even further north. ", " This has allowed us to become a command centre for much offshore production while retaining and developing higher value-added manufacturing and services in Hong Kong. ", " Despite the recent setbacks resulting from the Asian financial turmoil, there can be no denying that our economic development over the last 20 years or so has been a resounding success. ", " Our standard of living has improved considerably as a consequence. ", " But competition is keen in the Region. ", " If we are to sustain and uplift our standard of living, we cannot seek to compete on low value added processes or cheap labour and land. ", " We have to be able to build a technology-based and knowledge-based economy. ", " An increasing proportion of the value added will have to come from innovation - not only in respect of products, but also in respect of processes and application; not only in respect of manufacturing, but also in respect of services. ", " No one will however be prepared to invest their time and effort in innovation if the output is easily stolen. ", " It is therefore critical that a robust regime of intellectual property protection is in place to support our economic development into the 21st century. ", " I realize that I may well be preaching to the converted. ", " However, I believe that many of the considerations applicable to Hong Kong are equally applicable to other economies in the Region and, indeed, in the rest of the world. ", " Hong Kong may have moved a little faster than some of our neighbours in recognizing that we cannot compete on cost alone. ", " But if our experience is anything to go by, it is only a question of time when an economy has to move from relying solely on cheap land and labour. ", " Climbing up the value added ladder is the way forward. ", " So the pressure to protect intellectual property will increasingly come from internal rather than external forces. ", " Against this background, and in an increasingly globalized world economy, different countries and territories face many common problems in protecting intellectual property rights. ", " For example, the ease of transport has inadvertently facilitated, among other perfectly worthy and legitimate causes, cross-border shipments of pirated and counterfeit goods. ", " Advances in technology have also enabled pirates to make infringing copies more easily than before. ", " This underlines the need for economies in the Region to meet regularly to examine and re-examine the problem and together lay down effective strategies to deal with changing situations. ", " Tackling the Problem ", " I now turn to how we in Hong Kong tackle the problem of piracy and counterfeiting. ", " Essentially we have a multiple-pronged approach: legislation, enforcement, education and cooperation with intellectual property rights owners. ", " (a) Legislation ", " As I have just said, the nature of the piracy problem is changing. ", " We have to ensure that our laws remain relevant to changing circumstances. ", " We also need to provide our enforcement officers with the proper legal tools to carry out their work effectively. ", " On 1 July, 1997, Hong Kong was reunited with the Mainland of China. ", " To prepare for the transition, we had to establish a new, independent set of laws for the protection of intellectual property rights. ", " Three ordinances were passed in June 1997 - the Copyright Ordinance, the Registered Designs Ordinance and the Patents Ordinance. ", " This was no easy task. ", " In the formulation of these laws, we had put in a great deal of effort to make them meet the highest possible standards in line with international norms. ", " I am pleased to say that our new laws now meet the standards set down in the Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, or the TRIPS Agreement as it is commonly known, of the World Trade Organisation. ", " International standards apart, we have always been mindful to take account of Hong Kong's own specific circumstances in approaching our legislative work. ", " For example, the high concentration of population here facilitates the selling of goods to a relatively large number of customers within a relatively short time, thus increasing the temptation for pirates to make and sell pirated copies or counterfeit goods. ", " We therefore believe that penalties for piracy and counterfeiting should be set at an appropriately high level to have the necessary deterrent effect. ", " Thus, under the Copyright Ordinance, the maximum penalty for possessing infringing copies for trade or business is a fine of HK$50,000 per infringing copy and imprisonment for up to four years. ", " Possession of \"plates\" for manufacturing infringing copies is subject to a maximum penalty of HK$500,000 in fine and imprisonment for eight years. ", " To enable us to deal more effectively with the piracy problem at source, we amended the subsidiary legislation of our Import and Export Ordinance last December to introduce a licensing requirement for the importation and exportation of equipment for manufacturing optical discs. ", " In March this year, the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance was enacted. ", " It requires all optical disc manufacturers to obtain a license from the Government, and adds a mandatory requirement for all locally manufactured optical discs to bear a source identification code. ", " Manufacturing optical discs without a valid license or forgery of a source code carries a maximum penalty of a fine of HK$500,000 and two years' imprisonment for a first conviction. ", " The penalties will double for repeat convictions. ", " The aim of these moves is to let the government keep better track of the production of optical discs, to distinguish legitimate businesses from illegal ones and to empower the enforcement agencies to tackle the problem at the production level. ", " We believe that, over time, the effect of these measures will filter down to, and reduce the problem at, the retail level. ", " b) Enforcement ", " Combating piracy and counterfeiting is a demanding task and is manpower intensive. ", " To make sure we have enough hands available, we will have doubled the number of officers in the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau of our Customs and Excise Department from 117 in 1994 to 237 in 1999. ", " The Bureau will be one of the most powerful intellectual property rights enforcement agencies in the Region. ", " Besides controlling the problem at the production level, our dedicated enforcement officers also attack the problem at the distribution and retail levels. ", " Our Customs officers conduct frequent territory-wide raids against retail outlets. ", " In this effort they are assisted by other law enforcement agencies from time to time. ", " In the first five months of this year, our law enforcement officers seized more than 28 million suspected pirated optical discs. ", " Retail piracy in some of the more notorious shopping arcades has subsided under our persistent enforcement efforts. ", " At the importation and distribution levels, our law enforcement officers have conducted many successful raids on storage premises and stepped up enforcement actions at various border control points. ", " We are also strengthening our work in the gathering of intelligence and are maintaining close contact with other enforcement authorities, including those in the Mainland. ", " We can be proud of our enforcement work. ", " Through these examples, I hope you can see not only our determination to combat the problem of intellectual property rights infringement, but also the considerable amount of resources and efforts that we have put in to fight this continuing battle. ", " (c) Education ", " Many experts in the audience will agree with me that no amount of legislation and enforcement is sufficient if the public continues to demand cheap pirated and counterfeit goods. ", " We therefore see public education as an equally important area of work in intellectual property rights protection. ", " We believe in the need to educate our public to respect intellectual property rights from an early age. ", " Thus we have started a series of education programmes to drive home the message. ", " Starting from last September, the Intellectual Property Department has been visiting secondary schools and talking to students directly about the importance of intellectual property protection. ", " By the end of May, officers of the department have already visited 93 schools and talked to 25,000 students. ", " During such talks, we cover the concept of intellectual property and the importance of its protection. ", " We also put great emphasis on going beyond mere theory and on exploring one's own potential and creativity. ", " If our young people realize the pleasure of enjoying the fruits of their own hard work, they will gradually take their own initiative to protect intellectual property rights. ", " (d) Cooperation with Intellectual Property Rights Owners ", " Intellectual property rights are private economic rights. ", " At the end of the day, it is critically important that we have the full cooperation of rights owners or their agents. ", " I am pleased to say that we have done quite well in this regard. ", " Rights owners and their representatives have on the whole been forthcoming in helping us to identify infringing copies, for example. ", " I believe that there is further scope in such cooperation. ", " Our public education drive is a case in point. ", " Indeed we are maintaining a regular dialogue with rights owners and other interested parties on this and other issues of mutual concern. ", " Challenges Ahead ", " I would now like to turn to future developments in protecting intellectual property rights and how we can further build on the foundation that we have laid. ", " I believe that the problem of piracy of optical discs will continue to be an area of concern in the next few years. ", " Whether we like it or not, the demand is still there. ", " And the potentially huge profit is a major incentive for pirates. ", " To keep the problem under control, regional cooperation to stop cross-border shipments of infringing goods is necessary. ", " We look forward to closer ties among enforcement authorities in the Region in this respect. ", " Another area of concern is the problem of piracy on the Internet. ", " Hong Kong is probably one of very few places which extend their copyright protection to materials on the Internet. ", " Nonetheless, even the most advanced of economies will acknowledge that there are many technical problems on the enforcement side. ", " To address this, we should ensure that we have qualified personnel who have the necessary computer knowledge, technological expertise and professional training to enable them to identify piracy and find ways to tackle the problem. ", " In addition, regional enforcement agencies and the computer industry will need to come together to find out how to employ technical means to bar illegal duplication of materials and how to equip enforcement officers with the tools to identify and track down infringement. ", " Again, regional cooperation is an important element in our efforts. ", " Crime in the digital environment is not confined to copyright piracy. ", " Physical communication and transport among economies is improving. ", " The Internet is increasingly being used by illegal businesses to provide electronically-hidden mail-order services for counterfeit articles; and by computer hackers to gain unauthorised commercial information and break open trade secrets. ", " These are all areas where we should prepare ourselves to move forward together in the future. ", " We should also consider ways to make the proof of copyright subsistence easier. ", " One possibility is to set up an international centralised copyright rights-management information system. ", " The concept is not a compulsory copyright registration system, but a voluntary database to assist the world's copyright owners to manage and assert their rights, as and when they need to. ", " By registering rights - particularly licenses and assignments - with such a system, rights owners and enforcement agencies from around the world would be able to have easier access to the verification of copyright, thus facilitating prosecution, and resulting in better protection of the interests of the rights owners. ", " There are of course many problems, both technical and legal, to be addressed in developing this concept. ", " I would invite all of you to give further thought to the subject. ", " Finally, we should study the suggestion to broaden legal liability in copyright piracy and counterfeiting to combat the problem of piracy at the consumer level. ", " For example, we are studying the possibility of applying closure orders to premises found with the production, distribution or trading of pirated and counterfeiting goods. ", " We also suspect that if we do not see a fall in consumer demand for pirated and counterfeit articles, we may have to visit the question of whether the consumer can continue to be given unlimited freedom to create market demand for illegal articles with such impunity. ", " These are controversial issues that cannot be dealt with lightly and we will need to ensure that all relevant considerations are taken into account. ", " Conclusion ", " We believe in an integrated approach to counter piracy and counterfeiting in the short term as well as in the longer term. ", " Only by such commitment could creativity, talent, trade and industry flourish. ", " I hope that I have been able to provide some points for discussion during this Symposium as well as after it. ", " I look forward to learning from your contributions. ", " Thank you.

", " Our co-hosting of this Symposium symbolises the strong commitment of Hong Kong to the protection of intellectual property rights. ", " The proceedings of the next three days will focus on the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the context of implementing the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS for short) under the World Trade Organisation. ", " Hong Kong is itself a founder Member of the World Trade Organisation and the subject of this Symposium is a very topical one. ", " Enforcement of intellectual property rights is a matter of intense local interest here, especially recently. ", " Effective enforcement can only flow from good laws. ", " Our set of laws on protection of patents, designs, trade marks and copyright works is one of the most complete and modern in the world. ", " That, of course, is not enough in itself. ", " Like many other economies, we face considerable challenges in our efforts to enforce these laws. ", " Our population is densely-packed and our society is strongly commerce-oriented. ", " We are a world telecommunications centre and a leading centre for film and television production. ", " The demand for cheap pirated optical discs is considerable and this provides the incentive for piracy or counterfeiting. ", " But my Government is determined to protect the creative talent of Hong Kong people, and to encourage investment here by providing proper protection for the intellectual property of our many foreign investors. ", " To achieve this, we are providing labour-intensive and highly professional policing of intellectual property rights. ", " Our Customs and Excise Department operates an Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau specialising in the criminal enforcement aspects of intellectual property protection. ", " Other law enforcement agencies in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region also contribute to this effort. ", " Seizures of pirated optical discs in the first five months of this year alone have already exceeded seizures for the entire 1997. ", " Vigorous action has also seen a high level of seizures of clothing and accessories bearing false trade marks. ", " While we can point to some success in our enforcement efforts, we are not complacent at all and realise only too well that continued vigilance is essential. ", " To some extent, we are probably victims of our own success as a major, strategically-positioned trading centre and free port, with a minimum of bureaucratic red-tape for the honest trader. ", " To reinforce our legislative and enforcement efforts, we need to do more in educating our traders not to take part in illegal activities which infringe intellectual property rights; and our general population not to demand cheap, pirated or counterfeit goods. ", " We have now increased our efforts in this area substantially, reaching out to school students and the community to help them understand the value of protecting the fruits of their own creativity, and hence the importance of respecting and protecting the rights of the others. ", " In the next few days, distinguished guests and delegates will grapple with the technicalities of compliance with the TRIPS Agreement in the area of intellectual property enforcement. ", " Apart from this, I would urge you to step back and take a broad view of the need to make a strong co-operative effort in educating the people of the Asian region to support the work of their governments.

", " The assurance was given by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr John Tsang Chun-wah, when addressing a luncheon of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce today (Thursday). ", " Mr Tsang, while outlining Customs work in curbing the rampant piracy activities, said, \"I am very happy to tell you that we have blinded the pirate in the remaining eye. ", " The piracy situation is now under control.\" ", " He noted that the extent of CD piracy in Hong Kong was shrinking rapidly due to the hard work of the largest dedicated professional enforcement unit in the world. ", " \"We take a two pronged enforcement strategy directed at the supply side and the retail end of the pirated CD business in our community,\" he said. ", " The Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance came into force in August last year, requiring CD factories to operate under Customs licence. ", " \"Having been assured of the legitimacy of our licensed factories, our investigation teams would turn to concentrate their energy on the underground plants,\" Mr Tsang noted. ", " He pointed out that since last September, Customs officers had cracked 11 underground CD factories and seized 18 production lines worth some $100 million. ", " \"Without a local source, supply of pirated CDs to the local market now comes mainly from nearby areas, as evident by the upsurge in our interceptions made at the airport, land and marine boundaries,\" he went on. ", " So far this year, Customs officers had intercepted some 800,000 CDs at these boundary points, he noted. ", " \"We are also putting tremendous pressure on pirated CD retail outlets in notorious shopping arcades,\" he said. ", " Apart from the 300 odd officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau, the Department has set up a 185-member Special Task Force to tackle the piracy problem on the street level. ", " The Special Task Force, drawing resources from other Customs formations to make up a 300 strong team on any major outing, launched its first territory-wide anti-piracy operation on June 30, Mr Tsang said. ", " \"Up to the end of August, just in a mere two months' time, some 750 shops have been raided, over 600 people arrested, and two million pirated products seized,\" he added. ", " He noted that due to the heightened enforcement pressure against the sale of pirated CDs, officers of the Special Task Force had encountered increasing resistance by illicit operators. ", " Mr Tsang, however, maintained that the resistance would not affect morale of the officers but helped to strengthen their resolve. ", " Speaking on police involvement in tackling the retail sale of pirated and counterfeit goods, Mr Tsang said Customs had a close working relationship with the Police. ", " \"Joint operations are mounted from time to time with raids at shopping arcades and hawking areas. ", " In addition, the Police and Customs have a standing arrangement of exchanging intelligence on IPR violations on a weekly basis,\" he added. ", " He noted that the use of repeated enforcement actions in the notorious black spots had proved its effectiveness. ", " \"We have now broken the back of the illicit business in the popular areas. ", " Vendors of pirated CDs have been forced out of their mainstream bases to operate underground, or to resort to very short-term leases in long vacated premises. ", " \"We intend to do even more on the legislative side to enhance our enforcement,\" he stressed. ", " The proposals, he cited, included amendments to make unauthorised recordings in cinemas an offence, to broaden the definition of infringing activities to include anything other than those intended for personal and domestic purposes, to incorporate copyright and counterfeiting offences into the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance for the purposes of attracting heavier penalties and forfeiture of monetary proceeds from such illegal activities. ", " \"We are also considering other amendments which will help facilitate enforcement. ", " Obviously, the degree of severity of these measures would have to be acceptable to the public,\" he said. ", " On courts punishment, Mr Tsang said, \"our courts also consider that IPR protection is critical for the protection of our society.\" ", " He added they had handed down heavy sentences to underline their resolve. ", " \"Recent sentences reached as high as 39 months of imprisonment and $1.04 million of fine. ", " Both cases concerned manufacturing of infringing CDs,\" he noted. ", " Turning to the role played by the industry in protecting intellectual property, Mr Tsang emphasized that the success of their strategy rested with the commitment of the industry. ", " Customs was the sole enforcement agent for the statutory offences, he explained, adding that the primary responsibility for the protection of the rights rested invariable with the property rights owners who could take civil litigations against unauthorised exploitation of those rights. ", " \"We maintain our already close working relationship with the industry,\" he said. ", " Customs has been managing the Anti-Piracy Reward Scheme funded by the industry since 1998 and some $1.3 million of reward money has been paid so far for information leading to successful prosecutions. ", " The Commissioner said the industry had been very supportive in general in helping the Department verify the authenticity of the seized CDs and provide the necessary administrative support in criminal prosecution. ", " \"In June this year, we have jointly launched with the Business Software Alliance the Genuine Software Action Campaign to give recognition to organisations with good internal software management,\" he continued. ", " He noted that the programme had generated a great deal of interest in the community. ", " Mr Tsang noted that the piracy problem could not be uprooted by mere stringent enforcement alone. ", " \"Incessant demand from the public will sustain the illicit trade, thereby nullifying the enforcement efforts and bringing irrevocable damage to Hong Kong's economy and reputation,\" he explained. ", " The long-term solution, therefore, rested with education in changing people's mentality, and in raising respect for intellectual property, he concluded.

", " The existence of the Y2K problem had been identified well before those years and we were perhaps naive at that time to expect that the major software suppliers would have had dealt with the matter. ", " The Government in 1996 began to add provisions in its IT contracts to require Y2K compliance. ", " However, in the case of packaged software this was not always practicable, because the products we needed were simply not yet available in Y2K compliant form. ", " We either had to accept products which were not Y2K compliant and rely on non-binding assurances from the suppliers that they would have upgrades and patches in time for installation before 1 January 2000, or to delay our projects. ", " It was fortunate that the major software suppliers have provided the upgrades or patches, but at extra effort and expenses to the customers. ", " The Government has also taken steps to alert organizations in Hong Kong of the need to examine their technology environments for any potential Y2K problem and take remedial action if necessary. ", " Our Year 2000 Web site provides much useful information about the Y2K problem and links to other Web sites around the world. ", " The Government has included non-government organizations in its Y2K monitoring programme to help ensure that the essential services provided by them will not be interrupted. ", " 9 September 1999 has been generally considered to be one of the critical dates for the smooth transition of computer systems to year 2000.

", " In the United States, some companies have already brought lawsuits against their insurance companies, claiming the costs of rectification arising from the Y2K problem. ", " Some people take that view that the disputes which could be caused by Y2K are very unusual, unprecedented and widespread, and therefore it is necessary to consider legislating. ", " On 16 July this year, the Legislative Council held a debate on a motion in respect of the Y2K problem. ", " In this motion, it was proposed, among other things, that the Administration should study whether it was necessary to introduce legislation on the legal responsibilities arising from Y2K. ", " The Administration has already given careful consideration to this issue and takes the view that it is unnecessary to introduce legislation. ", " In principle, the commercial disputes arising from Y2K would not be substantially different from disputes arising from other commercial transactions, and could be dealt with according to the existing legal principles. ", " If new specific legislation were to be enacted to provide for legal responsibilities, the legislation certainly would involve a lot of controversies and complex elements. ", " Much discussion and consultation would also be necessary. ", " Legislation is therefore unlikely to provide any solution within a short period of time. ", " On the contrary, during the legislative process, some people, or even most people, would most probably direct their efforts towards studying how to protect their own interests or evade responsibilities under the new law, instead of dealing with the Y2K problem. ", " From the result of voting in the Legislative Council on 16 July, we understand that a majority of the Legislative Councillors also took the view that it was not necessary to consider legislating for the Y2K problem. ", " The applications of existing legal principles, including those in relation to contract, tort and insurance, to the Y2K problem would of course involve some challenging and interesting issues. ", " The symposium today will be addressing legal issues which may arise if the Y2K problem causes actual damage. ", " These include: ", " 1. Does anyone have a legal responsibility to compensate for the damage? ", " 2. At this late date can one still do anything to prepare for the potential legal rights and liabilities, if any? ", " 3. As for persons in the middle of the \"technology chain\", would they become potential plaintiffs, or potential defendants, or both? ", " The topics to be discussed today also include \"alternative dispute resolution\" which operates outside the traditional judicial system. ", " While I of course have full faith in the competence of our judiciary to handle complex issues, parties concerned may prefer to use \"alternative dispute resolution\" forums such as mediation or arbitration. ", " These are fair, quick and cost-effective means of dispute resolution. ", " The use of these means should be encouraged. ", " As far as I know, many information technology contracts, including those in use in Hong Kong, have already contained provisions requiring the parties concerned to resort first to these means of dispute resolution when disputes take place. ", " I believe that when any person first hears about Y2K, it is quite difficult to understand why the omission of two numerals from computer programmes could cause widespread confusion, losses or even catastrophe, and why, at the stroke of midnight at the end of this year, our calendars would suddenly flip back a century to 1900.

", " As to the underemployment rate, increases mainly occurred in the construction and restaurants sectors, but a decrease occurred in the retail sector. ", " The unemployment and underemployment rates in the other major sectors remained relatively stable. ", " For the period June - August 1998, the size of the total labour force was 3,380,300, of whom 3,205,400 were employed and 174,900 were unemployed.

", " For the period July - September 1998, the number of unemployed persons and underemployed persons were provisionally estimated at 181,000 and 89,000 respectively. ", " The Government Economist, Mr K Y Tang said that the latest stabilisation in both the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate and underemployment rate was notable, after the sharp upsurge in the earlier months. ", " But lay-offs and wage-cuts were still reported most recently, and the adjustment to the adversities in the labour market was expected to continue for the time being.

", " This, together with the latest cut in interest rates, should help relieve the liquidity problem facing many small and medium enterprises, and generate a stimulating effect on the economy. ", " \"Employment prospects remain positive. ", " According to the Government's recent assessment, there will be at least some 100,000 job vacancies in the labour market by the end of 1999, largely as a result of the Government's key policy initiatives and major infrastructure or other projects, and partly because of the needs of the Civil Service. ", " Of these, around 15,000 have been created by mid-September. ", " We will produce an updated assessment by the end of this year in the light of the new initiatives and infrastructural projects set out in the 1998 Policy Address,\" Mr Wong said.

", " We therefore urge all employers affected by the current economic downturn to discuss their difficulties with their employees, with a view to reaching mutually acceptable agreements. ", " To facilitate such communications, the Labour Department has drafted a Code of Practice on how employers should properly handle problems arising from the need for retrenchments and pay adjustments. ", " The Labour Advisory Board will be consulted on this at its meeting on October 23(this Friday),\" Mr Wong added. ", " Meanwhile, the wide-ranging series of measures to ease unemployment and facilitate job creation announced by the Task Force on Employment are all in full swing.

", " We will ban the use of leaded petrol and introduce emission standards for motorcycles which have none at the moment. ", " We will continue to tighten fuel and emission standards as they become practicable and available locally. ", " The LPG taxi trial has proven that LPG taxis are safe and viable in Hong Kong. ", " We have worked out an implementation proposal taking into account results of the trial and views of the affected trades.

", " Actions taken in Hong Kong in the past year had gained time for scientists to find out more about the virus. ", " \"According to available evidence, it has been clearly established that the primary mode of transmission is a direct one from birds to humans,\" he said. ", " \"Out of the 1 366 poultry samples collected in markets just before the mass chicken slaughter, nearly 19 per cent of samples from chickens and about 2 per cent from ducks were found to contain the virus.\" ", " Results of studies available so far confirmed that the primary mode of transmission of H5N1 infection is from poultry to man, most likely through contact with the faeces of poultry.

", " The latest date of onset for a human case of avian flu was December 28, 1997, one day before the mass chicken slaughter was launched. ", " To ensure a safe supply of poultry upon restocking, stringent controls on import of chicken and other poultry had been introduced by the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) prior to and after the resumption of import of these poultry into the territory. ", " This had so far been working smoothly. ", " Over 200 000 blood samples have been examined. ", " No evidence of active infection with avian influenza had been detected in any consignment of imported poultry. ", " On the local front, on-farm testing of birds was introduced for poultry on farms, along with new licensing conditions covering hygiene and management practices. ", " All flocks are serologically tested during the growing period. ", " All farms had remained free from infection with H5 influenza so far. ", " To prevent H5N1 virus being passed on from waterfowl, a potential carrier, to chicken, the policy of segregation of waterfowl from other poultry was introduced in May this year at all levels from import to retail with the support and co-operation of the traders. ", " All these, together with surveillance on birds and markets conducted by the AFD, had safeguarded the health of poultry and ensured the disease did not occur. ", " Great emphasis had also been placed in upgrading the hygiene standard of markets at both wholesale and retail level. ", " Additional requirements and conditions had been imposed by the two municipal services departments on the licensed fresh provision shops and market stalls selling poultry. ", " These included requirements to use plastic or metal poultry cages instead of wooden cages, provision of refrigerator or chiller for keeping poultry carcasses, water heaters and high pressure water jet cleaner for daily cleansing etc. ", " Dr Saw pointed out that the overall hygiene standard of poultry retail outlets is now much improved. ", " Enhancement of hygiene standard is on-going and the poultry retail outlets are subject to regular inspections by the health inspectors. ", " On the education and publicity front, to enlist the public to combat the avian flu, guidelines for influenza prevention were prepared for doctors, health care workers, schools teachers, staff of child care service units, rehabilitation service units and elderly centres. ", " People handling poultry and animal waste were advised on personal hygiene and ways to prevent contact with poultry faecal matter. ", " These were backed up by general publicity on TV, radio and the printed media.

", " I will talk about the development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong. ", " Let us first take a look at the opportunities and challenges faced by businesses in the Information Age. ", " In the information world of today, there are few areas of our everyday life which are not touched by information technology in one form or another. ", " A prominent feature of the Information World is the phenomenal growth of the Internet. ", " By exploiting the convergence of computing power, telecommunications and multi-media presentation, the Internet has created an ever expanding and digitally connected virtual community - a community which transcends geographical and time boundaries. ", " This ever-expanding virtual community is not only a vast source of information and resources; it also provides new and enormous business opportunities. ", " To put in perspective the astonishing speed at which the Internet and the globally connected virtual community have developed, I should perhaps cite some statistics here. ", " It took 38 years for the radio to reach an audience of 50 million people globally, and 13 years for television. ", " But it took the Internet only four years to cross that threshold. ", " The number of Internet users worldwide has now exceeded 100 million and is growing by the minute. ", " Traffic on the Internet has been doubling every 100 days. ", " And the volume of transactions over the Internet has been surging too. ", " Recent industry estimates suggest that global purchases through the Internet will increase to US$220 billion by 2001. ", " The potential market for electronic commerce that one can tap in cyberspace is thus enormous. ", " Experience in the US has shown that electronic commerce is transforming the way that business is operated. ", " There are some key issues which I would like to highlight. ", " First, development of new markets. ", " The Internet knows no geographical boundaries or time zones. ", " Through electronic commerce conducted over the Internet, we can reach new markets which may be too costly to explore through conventional means. ", " This is particularly useful to small and medium sized enterprises which cannot afford the cost of establishing physical presence overseas to tap these markets. ", " Second, reduction of sales and marketing costs. ", " There are many constraints for businesses to physically expand their sales force in order to cope with market demands. ", " However, with electronic commerce, expansion of sales activities would require minimum additional cost and effort as the expansion could often be achieved by simply expanding the capacity of the network servers. ", " This is of course much cheaper and more flexible than the employment of additional sales personnel. ", " Third, reduction in inventory. ", " Through closer and more direct contact with both customers and suppliers via the Internet, we can trim down unproductive inventory, shorten production cycle and reduce throughput time. ", " Fourth, better customer relationship. ", " By putting information on product description, support services or order status online, we will be able to provide more efficient and effective services to our customers. ", " The services can also be individually customised to build up customer loyalty in an increasingly competitive world. ", " The points I have just set out should have made it crystal clear that Hong Kong has to embrace electronic commerce in order to stay competitive in the information world. ", " The HKSAR Government fully recognises the importance of electronic commerce in driving our future growth. ", " We are firmly committed to promoting the development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong, especially amongst the small and medium sized enterprises, which make up over 95% of our businesses. ", " It is our aim to provide a favourable environment for electronic commerce to take hold and flourish in Hong Kong. ", " Let me take this opportunity to outline Government initiatives in this important area. ", " First, we will take an active part in demonstrating to the community the benefits of electronic commerce by becoming a leading user. ", " We will launch the Electronic Service Delivery scheme - a scheme to provide Government services over the Internet. ", " Our aim is not only to provide more efficient and better quality public services to the community, but also to encourage the community to accept electronic commerce as an integral part of daily living. ", " By raising general awareness in, and acceptance, of electronic business, the ESD scheme will also act as a catalyst to pump-prime the development of electronic commerce in the private sector. ", " We will establish an open and common information infrastructure accessible throughout the territory for our ESD scheme. ", " At a later stage, we intend to open up the infrastructure for the conduct of electronic commerce by the private sector. ", " We have invited tender for the supply of the Electronic Service Delivery system. ", " The tender exercise will close on 9 April. ", " We expect to have the first phase of the scheme up and running in the latter half of next year. ", " Phase I will cover the services of ten departments and public agencies. ", " Second, we will provide a safe and secure environment for the conduct of electronic commerce through the establishment of a local public key infrastructure and the public certification authorities. ", " With the use of digital signatures using public/private key mechanism, we will be able to establish the identity of the parties to an electronic transaction, authenticate electronic messages, guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of the messages and ensure that they cannot be repudiated. ", " Government will take the lead through the Hongkong Post. ", " The department has just invited tenders for the supply of the system and services for the establishment of a local public certification service. ", " The tender exercise will close on 5 March. ", " The service should be up and running by the end of this year. ", " Third, we will develop a clear legal framework to provide certainty in the conduct of electronic transactions. ", " We will give the same legal recognition to electronic records and digital signatures as that for their paper-based counterparts. ", " We are now working on a bill to establish the legal framework, and we aim to introduce the bill into the Legislative Council within the next quarter. ", " Fourth, we will launch a series of publicity and promotion activities to encourage the business community to adopt electronic commerce. ", " My speaking to you this afternoon is part of our efforts in that area. ", " Fifth, we will try to nurture the growth of our IT industry as a strong IT industry is essential to the development of applications for electronic commerce. ", " A key element in our strategy is to outsource Government IT projects as much as practicable. ", " In 1998-99, Government spending on IT is expected to reach HK$2.1 billion, an 11 % increase over the last financial year. ", " Despite the current economic downturn, we will continue to push vigorously the use of IT within Government, both to improve services and to enhance productivity. ", " Starting from next financial year, all new IT development and maintenance projects will, as a preference, be outsourced unless there are over-riding reasons for retaining the work in-house. ", " Our target is to outsource two-thirds of all new IT projects in Government by 2001 so as to create a market of sufficient size to stimulate the development of the IT industry.

", " As part of the Government, Hongkong Post will also act as the public Certification Authority (CA), which is responsible for the issuance, renewal and revocation of digital certificates, from next Monday (January 31). ", " To enable the large scale deployment of the PKI technology which in turn facilitates the development of e-commerce, the Government does not impose any ceiling and mandatory licensing requirements for private sector to set up its CAs to meet different demands from the community. ", " On a voluntary basis, the CAs may apply for government recognition from the Director of Information Technology Services, who is empowered to be the authority for granting government recognition to CAs under the Electronic Transactions Ordinance. ", " Standards and procedures for recognized CAs to carry out their functions have been specified in the Code of Practice for Recognized Certification Authorities issued on January 14. ", " With the enactment of the Electronic Transactions Ordinance by the Legislative Council on January 5, a clear and supportive legal framework for the conduct of e-commerce in Hong Kong is established. ", " Under the Ordinance, electronic records and digital signatures are given the same legal status as that of their paper-based counterparts and a legal backing is established to promote and facilitate the operation of CAs. ", " \"For e-commerce to flourish in Hong Kong and to reach out to all potential customers, we must have a Chinese language interface that is open and common for users in the community who prefer to communicate electronically in Chinese,\" Mr Lau said. ", " To solve the problem of multiple coding standards of Chinese characters in electronic communications, the Government is taking an active role in the ongoing discussions with the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) on the development of the ISO 10646 standard. ", " The ISO 10646 standard is intended to encompass all written scripts, including the Chinese characters commonly used in Hong Kong. ", " In the long run, the Government is going to adopt the ISO 10646 standard as the open and common Chinese language interface in Hong Kong.

", " Based on the latest industry forecast, the total value of electronic transactions on a global basis will rise to over US$400 billion annually by 2002. ", " The projected growth rate is 40 times that of the global Gross Domestic Product. ", " Electronic commerce is therefore widely recognised as the engine to drive future economic growth. ", " The development of electronic commerce will enhance our productivity and efficiency, and thereby strengthening our overall competitiveness. ", " Countries around the world are actively promoting the development of electronic commerce. ", " In order to enable us to interface effectively with our major trading partners who are driving intensively in developing electronic commerce in the Information Age, we must seek to facilitate and promote the development of electronic commerce with the same vigour. ", " Electronic commerce is in its early stage of development in Hong Kong. ", " With the right environment, it is ready to grow. ", " To promote the wide adoption of this new mode of doing business, the Government is committed to providing a conducive environment for electronic commerce to take hold and flourish in Hong Kong, and for electronic commerce to be accepted by the community as a part of our daily lives. ", " The Government is also committed to taking necessary actions to address public concerns about the legal status as well as the security and certainty of electronic transactions. ", " Electronic Transactions Bill ", " The objectives of drafting the Electronic Transactions Bill are two-fold : first, to establish a clear legal framework to give electronic records and digital signatures the same legal status as that of their paper-based counterparts; and second, to establish a suitable framework for the operation of certifications authorities so as to ensure trust and security in the conduct of electronic transactions. ", " Electronic Records and Digital Signatures ", " To give electronic records and digital signatures used in electronic transactions the same legal status as that of their paper-based counterparts, we propose to introduce the following provisions in the Bill, along the line of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law - Model Law on Electronic Commerce - ", " (a) where a rule of law requires or permits information to be given or presented in writing, the use of electronic records will satisfy the rule of law; ", " (b) where a rule of law requires information to be retained, or to be presented or retained in the original form, that requirement is met by retaining or presenting the information in the form of electronic records; ", " (c) where a rule of law requires a signature of a person, that requirement is met by a digital signature; ", " (d) contracts shall not be denied legal effect solely on the ground that electronic records are used in their formation; and ", " (e) electronic records shall not be denied admissibility as evidence in court on the sole ground that they are electronic records. ", " Exemptions ", " While it is our policy objective to promote the wider adoption of electronic transactions, we recognise that for the time being certain types of transactions and procedures would preferably be conducted through conventional means for the time being because of their solemnity, significance, complexity or other factors. ", " We therefore propose to exempt certain generic items from the operation of the relevant provisions in the Bill. ", " These items include wills, trust, statutory declarations, affidavits, power of attorney, court orders, warrant, bills of exchange, and documents or instruments concerning land or property transactions, etc. ", " In addition, judicial proceedings will also be exempted from the operation of the relevant provisions inthe Bill. ", " When the courts and tribunals have ascertained that electronic information can be accepted in their proceedings in future, the authorities for making court rules may withdraw the relevant exemptions. ", " We recongise that some Government departments may not be able to accept electronic information under certain rules of law because of operational, technological or other reasons. ", " To address this, we have proposed a mechanism in the Bill whereby specific rules of law can be exempt from the operation of the relevant provisions in the Bill by means of subsidiary legislation. ", " The departments concerned will review the exemptions from time to time and consider removing them at appropriate time. ", " We also recognise that individual departments which can accept electronic information under certain rules of law may only be able to do so if such electronic information has been prepared in a specified format and using a specified type of software. ", " To deal with such situations, we have also proposed a mechanism in the Bill whereby individual departments may, where necessary, specify format and procedural requirements for the submission of electronic information under a rule of law. ", " Certification Authorities ", " To provide a secure and trusted environment for the conduct of electronic transactions, Government will establish a local public key infrastructure through the support of certification authorities. ", " With the issue of digital certificates by certification authorities and through the use of digital signatures and public/private key encryption, individuals and businesses will be able to establish the identity of the opposite party in electronic transactions, authenticate electronic messages received, ensure that the confidentiality and integrity of electronic messages exchanged will not be breached and safeguard against the repudiation of electronic transactions. ", " Voluntary Recognition Scheme ", " We do not propose to introduce a mandatory licensing scheme for the regulation of certification authorities so as to encourage the development of certification authorities to meet the needs of the market. ", " However, to protect consumer interest, we propose to introduce a voluntary system of recognition whereby certification authorities are free to apply for recognition from Government. ", " . The Director of Information Technology Services will be the authority for granting Government recognition to certification authorities under the Bill. ", " Certification authorities applying for recognition must achieve a trust standard in their operation which is acceptable to Government and adopt a common and open interface to ensure inter-operability with other recognised certification authorities under the local public key infrastructure before Government recognition will be granted. ", " The Bill further stipulates that certification authorities must comply with the following requirements - ", " (a) publication of a certification practice statement which clearly specifies the practices and standards adopted for issuing certificates to subscribers; ", " (b) use of a trustworthy technical system in performing certification authority services; ", " (c) engagement of an approved professional to conduct an annual audit on the provision of certification authority services; and ", " (d) compliance with a code of practice issued by Government. ", " If we detect any failure to comply with these requirements by a recognised certification authority, we may suspend temporarily or revoke the recognition granted. ", " We believe that, through the operation of the voluntary recognition system, we can facilitate the development of certification authorities in Hong Kong. ", " Consumers will also be able to assess the trust standard of individual certification authorities and to make an informed choice when obtaining certification authority services. ", " To encourage certification authorities to seek Government recognition under the proposed voluntary regime, we have stipulated in the Bill that the provision therein regarding legal recognition of digital signatures applies only to those digital signatures supported by recognised certificates issued by certification authorities which are recognised by Government. ", " In addition, we have, in line with common practice adopted elsewhere, introduced a provision to allow recognised certification authorities to limit their liability in the issue of recognised certificates under prescribed situations. ", " The limitation applies only when the recognised certification authority concerned has complied with the various requirements under the Bill, and has not acted negligently, intentionally or recklessly. ", " We consider these measures crucial in encouraging the development of a public key infrasturcture and the establishment of certification authorities in Hong Kong. ", " Certification authorities which have not obtained recognition from Government are outside the application of the Bill. ", " They will rely on common law principles in providing certification authority services to their subscribers. ", " In order to establish a public key infrastructure in Hong Kong as soon as possible, Government will take the lead in establishing a public certification authority through the Hongkong Post, which will start to provide public certification services to the local public and businesses on a non-exclusive basis by the end of 1999. ", " The early approval of this Bill will facilitate the promotion of public certification services. ", " In addition to the Hongkong Post, the private sector is free to set up certification authorities in Hong Kong to serve the needs of the community. ", " The number of certification authorities to be established in Hong Kong will be determined entirely by market force. ", " Conclusion ", " Madam President, the Electronic Transactions Bill will lay the foundation for the development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong. ", " To enable Hong Kong to take the stride forward, to cope with the development in the new era and to maintain our competitiveness in the new Information Age, I wish to appeal to Members that the Bill should be examined at the earliest opportunity. ", " I also appeal for Members' support to the Bill so that the Bill can be enactedas soon as possible, thus providing a safe and secure environment in the community for the conduct of electronic transactions. ", " Madam President, I beg to move. "], "19990226_038.e": [" Government pledges to promote E-commerce ", " The Government is firmly committed to promoting the development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong, especially amongst the small and medium sized enterprises. ", " This was stated by the Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting, Mr K C Kwong, when addressing members of the business associations of Germany, Australia, Austria, France, Singapore and Hong Kong today (Friday). ", " He told the gathering that the Government, fully recognising the importance of electronic commerce in driving Hong Kong's future economic growth, had taken a number of initiatives aimed at providing a favourable environment for electronic commerce to take hold and flourish in the territory. ", " First, he said, the Government would launch the Electronic Service Delivery (ESD) scheme which would provide Government services over the Internet. ", " \"Our aim is not only to provide more efficient and better quality public services to the community, but also to encourage the community to accept electronic commerce as an integral part of daily living,\" he said. ", " \"By raising general awareness in, and acceptance of, electronic business, the ESD scheme will also act as a catalyst to pump-prime the development of electronic commerce in the private sector.\" ", " The Government is currently inviting tenders for the supply of the ESD system. ", " The first phase of the scheme will cover the services of 10 departments and public agencies, and is expected to be operational in the latter half of next year. ", " Mr Kwong noted that, in parallel with the introduction of ESD, the Government was working on several fundamental issues which were essential to the development of electronic business in Hong Kong. ", " They include the establishment of a public key infrastructure and a public Certification Authority to provide a safe and secure environment for the conduct of electronic commerce. ", " He explained, \"With the use of digital signatures using a public/private key mechanism, we will be able to establish the identity of the parties to an electronic transaction, authenticate electronic messages, guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of the messages and ensure that they cannot be repudiated.\" ", " The Hongkong Post will establish the public Certification Authority by the end of this year. ", " In addition, the Government will introduce legislation to ensure that electronic records and digital signatures are accorded the same degree of recognition and protection in law as their paper-based counterparts. ", " \"We are now working on a bill to establish the legal framework, and we aim to introduce the bill into the Legislative Council within the next quarter,\" said Mr Kwong. ", " Noting that a strong IT industry is essential to the development of applications for electronic commerce, Mr Kwong said the Government was set to outsource its IT projects as much as practicable. ", " He said Government spending on IT was expected to reach $2.1 billion in 1998/99, an increase of 11 per cent over the last financial year. ", " And despite the current economic downturn, the Government will continue to push vigorously the use of IT within Government, both to improve services and to enhance productivity. ", " \"Starting from next financial year, all new IT development and maintenance projects will, as a preference, be outsourced unless there are over-riding reasons for retaining the work in-house. ", " \"Our target is to outsource two-thirds of all new IT projects in Government by 2001 so as to create a market of sufficient size to stimulate the development of the IT industry,\" Mr Kwong said. ", " He was confident that the Government initiatives he outlined would create a favourable environment for the development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong.

", " In his Policy Address, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has stated his vision to make Hong Kong a leader, not a follower, in the information world of tomorrow. ", " In line with the global trends, and in consideration of our own strength and resources, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has formulated the \"Digital 21\" Information Technology Strategy based on four enabling factors - ", " * The hardware of high capacity communications systems; ", " * A common software interface mounted on established communications networks, through which individuals, business and Government can interact easily and accurately using their own systems; ", " * People who know how to use IT; and ", " * A cultural environment that stimulates creativity and welcomes advances in the use of IT. ", " A major thrust of this strategy is to enhance the information infrastructure of Hong Kong in order for us to take advantage of the rising prospects of e-commerce. ", " Several initiatives are being materialised from this strategy. ", " Electronic Transactions Bill ", " A new bill entitled the Electronic Transactions Bill will be introduced later this year to provide the necessary legal framework and a secure and trusted environment for the conduct of electronic transactions in the HKSAR. ", " With the enactment of this bill, legal recognition will be given to electronic records and digital signatures. ", " It will also provide the legal framework for the operations of the Certification Authorities (CAs) to authenticate the identity of participants in electronic commerce. ", " Electronic Services Delivery (ESD) Scheme ", " To take the lead in using electronic transactions, the HKSAR Government will launch the Electronic Services Delivery (ESD) scheme. ", " The first phase of ESD will be implemented in the latter half of 2000 and 37 types of public services from 10 government departments and public agency will be available on-line, 24 hours a day and seven days a week. ", " A total of six tender proposals have been received and it is expected that tender evaluation will be concluded in the 3rd quarter of this year. ", " Establishment of a Public Key Infrastructure and a Public Certification Authority ", " To support the ESD, Hongkong Post will establish a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in order to provide a secure and safe environment conducive to the development of e-commerce in Hong Kong. ", " With this PKI, not only Government services could be delivered securely over the public networks, a foundation will also be built for the delivery of electronic services of other organisations and firms. ", " The Contract on the Design, Development and Implementation of a PKI was awarded on 26 May 1999 using GTE Cyber Trust PKI technology, and the system would be ready for live run in December this year. ", " Hongkong Post will also serve as the Public Certification Authority by the end of this year. ", " By following the open standard of PKI, Hongkong Post will offer flexible and customisable certification services meeting the different requirements of the community. ", " It will offer a high trust certification brand name known as \"Hong Kong Post e-Cert\" based on face-to-face authentication, 1024-bits key pairs and with a liability of about USD100,000. ", " Setting up of a Certification Authority Recognition Office ", " Hongkong Post will be the first CA and the private sector is free to set up more CAs to meet the demand of electronic commerce in the HKSAR. ", " To protect consumer interests and enhance users' confidence in electronic transactions, Government will set up a Certification Authority Recognition Office in end 1999. ", " CAs are free to apply for recognition from the Government on a voluntary basis, but only those CAs which have achieved a trust standard and will adopt a common and open interface in their operation will be recognised. ", " The Electronic Transactions Bill will provide for the recognition of not only a CA, but also the certificates issued by a recognised CA. ", " The bill will also provide for the revocation and suspension of the recognition of a CA or recognised certificates, should the CA fails, for example, to conform to the certification practice statements, to use a trustworthy system, or to comply with a code of practice issued by the Certification Authority Recognition Office. ", " Event like today's is a timely reminder to us that our cyber plans must be built upon solid technological foundation. ", " Our prospect in e-commerce is inseparable from our ability to master cryptographic techniques. ", " For this, I would like to thank the City University of Hong Kong for organising this valuable series of lectures and workshops.

", " We will put in place an enhanced gatekeeping mechanism by the summer of 2000 to target subsidized residential care service to the frail elderly with genuine need so that their waiting time can be shortened. ", " (ii) The Social Welfare Department will be introducing a pilot project on continuum of care in residential care homes. ", " Residential care homes taking part in the pilot will be provided with additional resources to provide higher levels of care services for their frail elderly residents. ", " This will reduce the need for transfer of elderly residents between residential care homes providing different levels of care. ", " Overseas experience has also shown that upon implementation of the continuum of care funding formula, residential care homes are more inclined to admit frail elderly with higher levels of care needs, thereby reducing their waiting time for admission to residential care homes.

", " The relaxation is also intended to tie in with the arrangements under the Tenants Purchase Scheme by bringing in a uniformed and consistent approach in resale restrictions for the two schemes. ", " Owners can sell their flats in the open market, subject to payment of a premium proportionate to the original discount, after five years from first assignment. ", " This will replace the existing 10-year resale restriction rule. ", " A spokesman for the Authority said: \"The Authority will not buy back flats after the five-year restriction period since these flats can be sold in the open market.\" ", " Besides, HOS flats could be put on sale in the HOS secondary market a year earlier following the relaxation that allows owners to sell their flats, between two to five years of first assignment, to sitting public rental housing tenants and Waiting List applicants at a negotiated price without the payment of premium. ", " Another option for these HOS owners is to apply to sell their flats back to the Authority at assessed market value less the original discount. ", " \"This is a revised basis for determining buy-back price of HOS flats which relates the price assessment to the original discount the purchasers enjoyed at the initial purchase,\" ", " \"The new provision, which replaces the original HA practice of buying back at prevailing HOS price, will be a more equitable arrangement particularly in light of the various discounts rates used in different phases of sale,\" the spokesman added. ", " Also with the relaxation, the Authority would accept offers of buy-back at original price from owners whose property is within two years of first assignment. ", " Following the approval, actions will be taken to amend the Schedule to the Housing Ordinance to provide legal teeth to the new resale criteria. ", " Meanwhile, the HOC also reviewed the management fees for 102 HOS estates, approving to freeze the rates for 80 of them and increase those of another 21 after considering the financial position of the courts' management funds. ", " The spokesman said, \"With the joint efforts of the departmental staff and the property management agents, we have succeeded in maintaining handsome surplus for 80 estates where the current fee levels can be frozen for another fiscal year.\" ", " At present, all HOS estates are managed by private management agents under the supervision of the Housing Department. ", " Management fees are used to cover management and maintenance expenses and are charged on a cost-recovery basis. ", " The average management fee per square meter is $9.14 for all HOS estates. ", " The monthly management fees for 21 HOS estates, however, will be revised to range from $399 to $710 a month, a slight increase in $2 to $32 per flat. ", " The increase, to be effective for a year from 1 April, is considered necessary to maintain a healthy financial position of the management funds. ", " The Committee also noted that the Supervision Cost, charged by the Housing Department to cover the cost of supervisory staff and administrative overheads in the management fee, will be frozen at $30.30 per flat per month in the next financial year for the third consecutive year.

", " At present, these schemes include the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS), the Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS) and the Home Purchase Loan Scheme (HPLS). ", " The measures, applicable to all home ownership schemes to be announced after 14 January 1999, were endorsed by the Authority's Rental Housing Committee (RHC) at a meeting today (Thursday). ", " They will help deter tenants who tend to hold on to their PRH units after purchasing a flat under HOS, PSPS and HPLS through Green Forms. ", " Under the new measures, tenants who make use of Green Forms to purchase a flat under these schemes will be asked to tender notices-to-quit (NTQ) at the time of taking over their HOS/PSPS flats or effecting the assignment in the case of HPLS to terminate their tenancies and surrender the PRH flats within one calendar month. ", " For any extended stay after the expiry of the NTQ, the tenants concerned will be charged an occupation fee equivalent to three times the net rent plus rates. ", " In the case of market rent payers, the amount will be equivalent to the market rent or three times the net rent plus rates, whichever is higher. ", " The time ceiling allowed for PRH tenants to surrender their flats will be three months. ", " Any application for further extension will normally not be considered. ", " Exceptional cases on strong compassionate ground will have to be considered by the Regional Chief Manager/Management on individual merits. ", " Currently, successful Green Form applicants of various home ownership schemes are required to surrender their PRH unit within two calendar months subsequent to taking over of their new flat. ", " However, tenants used to put forth different reasons such as decoration/fitting-out difficulties and social/medical problems in order to extend their holding over period. ", " There was also no maximum of the time limit for these tenants to surrender their PRH flats. ", " A spokesman for the Authority said in principle, the Authority can cease subsidies to those occupiers who fail to deliver up vacant possession of the PRH flats after the expiry of the NTQ. ", " \"It is inequitable to allow PRH tenants in possession of self-owned flats to enjoy double housing benefits for any prolonged period,\" said the spokesman, adding that the new time frame has already taken into account the difficulties that may arise for tenants to vacate their PRH flats within too short a period of time. ", " Those successful Green Form applicants of home ownership schemes announced prior to 14 January 1999 will be reminded of the need to surrender the PRH units within two calendar months. ", " An occupation fee equivalent to three times the net rent plus rates will be charged for any extended stay. ", " In the case of market rent payers, the amount will be equivalent to the market rent or three times the net rent plus rates, whichever is higher. ", " The spokesman said the new measures are in line with the recommendations of the Office of Ombudsman, which in an investigation unveiled that about 20 per cent (8,955) of the PRH flats surrendered by successful applicants of various home ownership schemes for the period 1992/93 to 1996/97 were recovered beyond the normal two-month time frame. ", " Other measures corresponding to the Ombudsman's recommendations include the enhancement of Housing Department's IT system to facilitate Estate Housing Managers and the respective District Senior Housing Managers to monitor the flat recovery situation.

", " For those of you who are visiting Hong Kong, may I extend a warm welcome and wish you an enjoyable and rewarding stay here. ", " Hong Kong is, I believe, an appropriate location for this conference. ", " Not only does it have a great deal to offer visitors, but also, so far as the ICCPR is concerned, it has set an example for other jurisdictions. ", " The ICCPR ", " The ICCPR has applied to Hong Kong, at the international level, since the year it came into force - 1976 - and it continues to apply to the Hong Kong SAR. ", " Since 1991, relevant provisions of the ICCPR, as applied to Hong Kong, have been incorporated into Hong Kong's domestic law by virtue of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. ", " That Ordinance is now one of the laws of the Hong Kong SAR. ", " Since reunification, the ICCPR has been given a special status in Hong Kong by virtue of Article 39 of the Basic Law, which is Hong Kong's new mini-constitution. ", " The first paragraph of Article 39 provides that the provisions of the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and shall be implemented through the laws of the Special Administrative Region. ", " The second paragraph provides that the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents shall not be restricted unless as prescribed by law, and that such restrictions shall not contravene the provisions of the preceding paragraph. ", " The ICCPR is therefore firmly rooted in Hong Kong's legal system. ", " On December 4, 1997, China's Permanent Representative to the UN issued a diplomatic note to the UN Secretary General informing him that, in line with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and considering that China is not yet a signatory to the ICCPR, China will make reference to the provisions under the ICCPR and transmit reports on the HKSAR to the UN through China's Permanent Representative to the UN. ", " The reports will be drafted by the SAR Government and submitted to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for onward transmission to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. ", " We plan to submit the first report in August this year. ", " Another welcome development occurred in March this year, when China announced that it would sign the ICCPR. ", " This is particularly significant for Hong Kong, since China's accession to the ICCPR will reinforce Hong Kong's human rights regime. ", " The resumption of sovereignty ", " As I am sure you all know, at the end of this month the Hong Kong SAR will celebrate its first anniversary. ", " I would therefore like to take this opportunity to review the effect of the reunification, and to discuss some of the significant legal developments that have occurred in the past 12 months. ", " Some of these developments have been the subject of criticism, but I firmly believe that, when properly understood in the context of the resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, they were fully justified. ", " Moreover, they were consistent with the SAR's obligations under the ICCPR. ", " So far as the legal system and human rights are concerned, the resumption of sovereignty has been highly successful. ", " Under the principle of 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has retained its own separate legal system, together with the rule of law and an independent judiciary. ", " The common law and almost all the statutory laws previously in force have been adopted as laws of the SAR. ", " All judges serving immediately before reunification were re-appointed on the recommendation of the independent Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission. ", " And the new Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, which replaces the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, makes our highest appellate court more accessible to litigants. ", " In addition, the local and overseas judges who have been appointed to that court are of the highest calibre, and have already given the court a reputation for quality, integrity and independence. ", " A further aspect of the new order that is significant is that, under Article 63 of the Basic Law, the Department of Justice of the SAR controls prosecutions, free from interference. ", " That department, which I head, is continuing to apply well-established and politically neutral criteria in respect of decisions to prosecute. ", " I wish to re-affirm that the political persuasion or personal connections of any suspected offender have not been, and will not be, factors in prosecution decision-making in the SAR. ", " The Bill of Rights Ordinance ", " As I said a moment ago, almost all the statutory laws previously in force have been adopted as laws of the SAR. ", " The basis for that position is Article 160 of the Basic Law. ", " This provides that, upon the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall be adopted as laws of the Region 'except for those which the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress declares to be in contravention of [the Basic Law].' ", " In February 1997, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress resolved that 24 Ordinances, in whole or in part, contravened the Basic Law and were not to be adopted as laws of the SAR. ", " Amongst the provisions that were not adopted were three provisions in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. ", " I hasten to add, however, that the non-adoption of these provisions did not dilute the rights and freedoms enshrined in that Ordinance. ", " The provisions in question stated - ", " * firstly, that in interpreting and applying the Ordinance, regard should be had to the fact that its purpose is to provide for the incorporation into the law of Hong Kong of provisions of the ICCPR; ", " * secondly, that all pre-existing legislation that admits of a construction consistent with the Ordinance shall be given such a construction, and legislation that does not admit of such a constructions is, to the extent of the inconsistency, repealed; and ", " * thirdly, that legislation enacted on and after the commencement of the Bill of Rights Ordinance shall, to the extent that it admits of such a construction, be construed as to be consistent with the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong. ", " As I said earlier, the continued application of the ICCPR is guaranteed by Article 39 of the Basic Law. ", " The non-adoption of the three provisions in the Bill of Rights Ordinance has not therefore diluted the rights and freedoms enshrined in the ICCPR, or the protection of those rights and freedoms in Hong Kong's domestic law. ", " Later on I will mention a number of cases in which the Bill of Rights has been relied upon in court challenges since Reunification. ", " The Provisional Legislative Council ", " Let me now turn to one of the most controversial aspects of the reunification, which was the establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council. ", " The political background to this development is well-known, but let me summarise the legal aspects of it. ", " Article 68 of the Basic Law provides that the Legislative Council shall be constituted by election. ", " Annex II of the Basic Law states that, in the first term, the Legislative Council shall be formed in accordance with a specified decision of the National People's Congress. ", " That decision was made on April 4, 1990, the same day as the Basic Law was promulgated. ", " The decision provided for a Preparatory Committee to be established in 1996, one task of which was to prescribe the specific method for forming the first Legislative Council of the SAR. ", " The decision also set out the composition of the first Legislative Council, namely 20 members to be returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, 10 members by an election committee, and 30 members by functional constituencies. ", " That, in fact, is the composition of the first SAR LegCo that was elected last month. ", " Where, you may ask, does that leave the Provisional Legislative Council? ", " The answer is as follows. ", " At the time of the promulgation of the Basic Law in April 1990, it was hoped that there would be a 'through train' for members of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council. ", " However, as a result of the political reforms instituted by the last Governor, this became impossible. ", " The composition of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council was not acceptable to the People's Republic of China. ", " As a result, in August 1994 the Standing Committee of the NPC authorised the Preparatory Committee to organise the first SAR Legislative Council in accordance with the 1990 decision of the NPC. ", " In March 1996 the Preparatory Committee decided to set up the Provisional Legislative Council. ", " The composition of that Council did not conform with the composition of the first SAR Legislative Council set out in the NPC's decision of 1990. ", " In particular, it was not formed by the kind of elections required by that decision. ", " But the Provisional Legislative Council never purported to be the first SAR Legislative Council. ", " It was an interim body set up, out of necessity, with limited terms of reference to assist the first SAR Government in the absence of the first Legislative Council. ", " Given the breakdown in the 'through train', it was simply not possible to establish the first SAR Legislative Council without some form of interim legislature. ", " In the absence of such a legislature, it would not have been possible to enact the electoral laws needed to establish the first SAR Legislative Council. ", " Moreover, other essential legislation could not have been passed, and government funding could not have been approved, at a critical time for the SAR. ", " The Provisional Legislative Council was therefore needed as a matter of political necessity. ", " There were those who argued that the Council was not legally constituted, since it was not provided for in the Basic Law. ", " Those arguments were put before the SAR's Court of Appeal in a landmark case in July of last year. ", " The court unanimously held that the Provisional Legislative Council was lawfully established by the Preparatory Committee, exercising the authority and powers conferred on it by the National People's Congress. ", " So far as the ICCPR is concerned, I would point out that when the United Kingdom ratified the covenant in 1976 it did so subject to certain reservations. ", " One of these was in respect of Article 25, which provides for periodic elections to be conducted by universal and equal suffrage. ", " The reservation was to the effect that the Article did not require the establishment of an elected Executive or Legislative Council in Hong Kong. ", " That reservation still applies to the Hong Kong SAR and is reflected in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. ", " Neither the Provisional Legislative Council, nor the first SAR Legislative Council, are therefore inconsistent with international obligations or domestic law applying in Hong Kong. ", " In my view, the Provisional Legislative Council served the Hong Kong SAR well. ", " Had there been no such interim legislature the results would have been potentially disastrous. ", " The Council put in place essential legislation and ensured that necessary funding for the SAR Government was available. ", " Some of the laws enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council were controversial. ", " I propose to review those controversial laws and explain how they are fully justified. ", " It is essential to bear in mind not only that the ICCPR applies to the SAR, but also that the SAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, and must comply with the Basic Law. ", " Certain amendments to our laws were a necessary part of the establishment of the SAR in accordance with the Basic Law. ", " Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance ", " Let me start with the amendments to the Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance enacted on July 1, 1997. ", " Both Ordinances have played a key role in maintaining law and order in Hong Kong. ", " However, a few years before Reunification, major amendments were made to them. ", " Under the Societies Ordinance as originally enacted, societies generally had to be registered. ", " In 1992 the Ordinance was amended in two important ways. ", " First, there was a repeal of the provision permitting the Registrar to refuse to register a society if it was connected with any political group established outside Hong Kong; and secondly, the registration system was replaced by a notification system. ", " The Public Order Ordinance contains provisions dealing with public meetings and processions. ", " In 1995, the Ordinance was amended, in particular, by replacing the licensing system that applied to public processions by a system of prior notification. ", " In February 1997, the Standing Committee of the NPC resolved that the major amendments to the Societies Ordinance and Public Order Ordinance made in 1992 and 1995 respectively would not be adopted as the laws of the SAR. ", " If no action had been taken, there would have been a legal vacuum after reunification, since there would have been no law governing the formation of societies or the regulation of public demonstrations and processions. ", " In order to avoid this, the Chief Executive of the SAR issued a consultation document in April 1997 in respect of proposals to amend the two Ordinances. ", " After taking into account public views received, the Chief Executive's Office prepared two Bills. ", " These were passed by the Provisional Legislative Council and came into effect on July 1, 1997. ", " In preparing these Bills, care was taken to ensure that restrictions imposed on freedom of association and freedom of assembly were consistent with the ICCPR. ", " In the case of the Societies Ordinance, new societies are now required to apply for registration, or exemption from registration, within one month of establishment. ", " An application may be refused if the Societies Officer reasonably believes that the refusal is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety, public order (ordre public) or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. ", " The Ordinance expressly states that the last three of these expressions are to be interpreted in the same way as under the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong. ", " An application may also be refused if the society is a political body that has a connection with a foreign political organisation or a political organisation of Taiwan. ", " This is consistent with Article 23 of the Basic Law, which requires the SAR to enact laws to prohibit political organisations or bodies in the SAR from establishing ties with foreign political organisations or bodies. ", " In the case of the Public Order Ordinance, organisers of public meetings and processions are required to notify the Commissioner of Police of their intention to hold the meeting or procession. ", " In the case of a proposed public procession, if the Commissioner of Police does not object to it, he must issue a 'notice of no objection'. ", " The Commissioner of Police may only prohibit a public procession or meeting if he reasonably considers that this is 'necessary in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public) or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.' Again, the last three of those expressions are to be interpreted in the same way as under the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong. ", " The amendments to the Public Order Ordinance and Societies Ordinance were subject to some criticism at the time they were made. ", " Some feared that they indicated an approach that was hostile to human rights. ", " That fear was misplaced. ", " The amendments struck the right balance between civil liberties and social order. ", " They reflected both the ICCPR and the Basic Law and, as I am sure you can see for yourselves, political activities and demonstrations in Hong Kong remain as lively as ever. ", " Let me illustrate that statement by some revealing statistics. ", " From July 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998, there have been over 1,260 public demonstrations in Hong Kong and 626 societies formed. ", " On average, about 140 demonstrations have been held each month since the handover, compared with 87 demonstrations a month before the handover in 1997. ", " The police have not objected to the holding of any of these demonstrations nor refused any application for formation of societies. ", " Legislative Provisions (Suspension of Operation) Ordinance 1997 ", " Let me now turn to another legislative problem that had to be faced after Reunification. ", " At the last sitting of the former Legislative Council in June 1997, a number of Private Members Bills were hastily passed without detailed scrutiny by a Bills Committee and without full consultation with those affected. ", " Considerable public concern was expressed about this legislation. ", " The SAR Government adopted a rational approach of promoting legislation to suspend the operation of four of those enactments, until their impact could be thoroughly analysed and proper consultation carried out. ", " Three of the enactments related to employment law. ", " The Administration reviewed those enactments in close consultation with the Labour Advisory Board - a well-established tripartite consultative forum comprising the Government, employers and employees. ", " At the end of the review, the Administration promoted legislation that was eventually passed by the Provisional Legislative Council. ", " The effect of that legislation was to repeal two of the employment Ordinances and amend the third. ", " The other Ordinance whose operation was suspended was the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (Amendment) Ordinance 1997. ", " I am sure that this will be of particular interest to delegates at this Conference. ", " The background to that Ordinance was as follows. ", " When the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance was enacted in 1991, it included a provision to the effect that it was binding only on the Government and public authorities, and on any person acting on behalf of the Government or a public authority. ", " The 1997 amendment, which was not scrutinised by any Bills Committee, added a provision stating that the Ordinance applied (and I quote) 'to all legislation, whether that legislation affects legal relations between the Government, public authorities and private persons, or whether it affects only relations between private persons.' ", " The operation of this amendment was suspended, pending a review of its implications. ", " Eventually, the Administration decided that the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance should be restored to its original form, and a Bill to repeal the amendment was enacted. ", " There were several objections to the amendment. ", " Its drafting and interaction with other parts of the Ordinance caused uncertainty and confusion. ", " More importantly, it could have greatly complicated litigation between private persons by bringing into question the validity of legislation affecting them. ", " It should be noted that although the ICCPR requires action to be taken in respect of certain types of activity, such as discrimination, by private citizens, this can and is being dealt with by specific legislation. ", " And Article 39 of the Basic Law, which I mentioned earlier, guarantees that Hong Kong residents will enjoy the standards of human rights prescribed in the ICCPR. ", " The amendment Ordinance was therefore more trouble than it was worth, and its repeal was not inconsistent with the Administration's commitment to protect human rights in Hong Kong. ", " Immigration Ordinance ", " Let me now turn to amendments to the Immigration Ordinance enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council. ", " It is, I think, self-evident that Hong Kong has to control the flow of immigrants from the Mainland. ", " Since 1982 this has been achieved through a One-Way Exit Permit System, which involves a daily quota of permits being issued by Mainland authorities. ", " This system has worked well. ", " The Reunification introduced a new factor in respect of immigration, since Article 24 of the Basic Law confers a right of abode in the SAR on a number of categories of people. ", " These include persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of Chinese citizens who were either born in Hong Kong or who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years. ", " The effect of that article is to confer a right of abode in the SAR on tens of thousands of children born and raised in the Mainland, who did not previously have such a right. ", " If all these children arrived at once, the impact on the social support services would be extremely difficult to bear. ", " Moreover, it would be undesirable to allow all children who claim to have the right of abode in Hong Kong to enter Hong Kong before their status can be determined. ", " The Administration therefore introduced amendments to the Immigration Ordinance to implement a Certificate of Entitlement Scheme in respect of such Mainland children. ", " In order to enjoy their right of abode, they must hold a valid travel document, which in practice means a valid one-way exit permit issued by Mainland authorities, to which there is affixed a valid certificate of entitlement issued by the Department of Immigration. ", " In order to obtain such a certificate, they must prove to the satisfaction of the Director that at least one of their parents had the right of abode in Hong Kong. ", " The scheme has been controversial - as immigration controls often are. ", " I will deal later with the legal challenges that have been made to the legislation. ", " For now, I would point out that other common law jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, have similar methods of verifying a person's immigration status; and that Hong Kong's new scheme has been running smoothly. ", " In the first nine months following Reunification, it has ensured a speedy and orderly admission of nearly 17,000 Mainland children. ", " Legislative Council Ordinance ", " I mentioned earlier that one of the essential tasks of the Provisional Legislative Council was to enact the electoral law that would make it possible for the first Legislative Council of the SAR to be established in accordance with the Basic Law. ", " That law, the Legislative Council Ordinance, was enacted in September last year, and regulated the election of Legislative Councillors that took place last month. ", " That election involved a record number of registered voters (2.8 million), a record number of candidates (166), and a record participation of 53 per cent of registered voters. ", " In accordance with the Basic Law, the first Legislative Council consists of 60 members, elected directly or indirectly. ", " Twenty members were elected by universal suffrage from geographical constituencies, on the basis of a proportional representation voting system. ", " Thirty members were indirectly elected from functional constituencies. ", " These constituencies represent economic and professional sectors, such as the labour, real estate and medical sectors, that are substantial and of importance to the community. ", " The final 10 members were indirectly elected by an Election Committee consisting of 800 members. ", " The great majority of those members were returned through elections supervised by an independent Electoral Affairs Commission. ", " These arrangements are in accordance with the Basic Law, which contains a blueprint for Hong Kong's democratic development. ", " Progress in this respect will be gradual and orderly. ", " For example, the proportion of members of the Legislative Council to be elected by universal suffrage will be increased to half for the Council's third term. ", " Further progress in this direction after the year 2007 can be decided upon by the community, in accordance with the Basic Law. ", " Adaptation of Laws (Interpretative Provisions) Ordinance 1998 ", " The final piece of legislation I will mention is an adaptation of laws Ordinance. ", " Following Reunification, the laws of Hong Kong need to be textually amended to remove colonial terminology that is no longer appropriate. ", " For example, references to the 'Governor' need to be replaced by references to the 'Chief Executive'. ", " One such amendment was recently made to a provision relating to the 'Crown'. ", " The provision stated that the Crown was not bound by any Ordinance unless the Ordinance contained an express provision, or a necessary implication, to the contrary. ", " This reflected a common law principle that applies in almost all common law jurisdictions. ", " In adapting that reference to the 'Crown', great care was taken to ensure that the new provision accurately reflected the meaning of that expression. ", " In this context, the 'Crown' included Her Majesty the Queen, the British Government, British Forces in Hong Kong, and the former Hong Kong Government. ", " The word 'Crown' was replaced by the word 'State', which was defined so as to encompass corresponding organs of the PRC. ", " These are the President of the PRC, the Central People's Government (CPG), central authorities which exercise functions for which the CPG is responsible under the Basic Law, the Government of HKSAR, and certain subordinate organs of the CPG or those central authorities. ", " A subordinate organ of the CPG or of those central authorities is within the definition of 'State' only if it satisfies the following three tests: ", " * it carries out executive functions of the CPG or functions for which the CPG has responsibility under the Basic Law; ", " * it does not exercise commercial functions; and ", " * it is acting within the scope of the functions and authority delegated to it by the CPG or the relevant central authority. ", " The adaptation of this provision therefore does no more, and no less, than preserve the substance of the law before Reunification and reflect the change in sovereignty. ", " It has, however, given rise to the most startling misconceptions. ", " Some overseas press reports stated that Chinese State-owned Enterprises have been given a special status in Hong Kong. ", " This is quite wrong. ", " The definition of 'State' expressly excludes any organs that exercise commercial functions. ", " And assertions that relevant State organs are 'above the law' are equally misleading. ", " No one ever asserted that the British Government, the British Forces in Hong Kong, or the former Hong Kong Government were above the law - because they were not. ", " The same position holds true of the SAR Government and relevant State organs. ", " I would add that Hong Kong's autonomy to enact laws that are binding on State organs is completely unaffected by this amendment. ", " Court challenges under the Basic Law ", " Having reviewed various Ordinances enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council, let me now turn to the court challenges that have been made to some of those Ordinances. ", " These challenges have been possible after Reunification because, for the first time, Hong Kong now has a detailed written constitution. ", " Litigants are therefore able to challenge legislation on the basis that it is inconsistent with the provisions in the Basic Law. ", " Those provisions include Article 39, which provides for the continued implementation of the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong. ", " I have already mentioned the case in which the legality of the Provisional Legislative Council was unsuccessfully challenged. ", " That case also involved an assertion that the common law had not survived Reunification, since it had not been positively adopted as part of the laws of the SAR. ", " Article 160 of the Basic Law provides that, upon the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong 'shall be adopted as laws of the Region'. ", " The court unanimously held that this article did not require any formal adoption of the laws previously in force and so the common law did survive Reunification. ", " There have also been challenges to the immigration legislation which introduced the certificate of entitlement scheme, and which implemented other relevant provisions of the Basic Law. ", " Those cases have now been heard by the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal and may yet be appealed to the Court of Final Appeal and so my following comments are subject to the outcome of any such appeal. ", " The scheme itself was attacked on four main grounds. ", " First, it was argued that a person who claims the right of abode in Hong Kong by descent is entitled under the Basic Law to entry into Hong Kong before he or she establishes the facts giving rise to the claim. ", " It was therefore claimed that those persons could not be required to produce a certificate of entitlement before being allowed entry. ", " Secondly, it was argued that it was not permissible to use immigration legislation as a means of avoiding the social problems that would arise if large numbers of Mainland children exercised their right of abode at the same time. ", " Thirdly, it was argued that the scheme was incompatible with Article 8(4) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, since it arbitrarily deprived persons of the right of abode in Hong Kong. ", " Fourthly, it was argued that the scheme could not lawfully be made retrospective to 1 July 1997. ", " The first three arguments were rejected by the court. ", " The Basic Law merely identifies the categories of persons who have the right of abode in Hong Kong, and leaves the question as to how the facts on which the claim to right of abode should be established to be determined by the legislature. ", " Moreover, the Basic Law itself requires persons living in Mainland China who seek to exercise their right of abode in Hong Kong to obtain a one-way exit permit from the Chinese authorities before coming to Hong Kong. ", " The fact that those claiming the right of abode by descent were singled out for the certificate of entitlement scheme did not deprive them of their right to enter Hong Kong, nor was it an arbitrary scheme. ", " With regard to provision making the legislative scheme retrospective to July 1, 1997, the court upheld the provision. ", " It held that the restrictions on the exercise of the right of abode were already contained in the Basic Law, which was in place on July 1, 1997. ", " It nevertheless held that the scheme did not apply to persons in Hong Kong who arrived before that date even though their presence in Hong Kong before that date was unlawful. ", " Two particular aspects of the legislation have also been challenged. ", " A provision requiring children born out of wedlock to derive their right of abode through their mothers and not through their fathers was declared to contravene the Basic Law and was excised from the legislation. ", " Such children were considered to be within the categories of children who are given the right of abode. ", " Another provision restricting the right of abode of children born outside Hong Kong to those whose mother or father had acquired the right of abode in Hong Kong by the date of their birth was at first held to contravene the Basic Law. ", " However, on appeal it was held that this provision reflected the plain meaning of the words of the Basic Law. ", " There is one further area, namely regulation of the civil service, which has been the subject of a challenge under the Basic Law. ", " Before Reunification, the regulation of the civil service was achieved by means of Colonial Regulations, issued by the Secretary of State to the Governor, and regulations made under them by the Governor. ", " After Reunification, the Chief Executive issued an Executive Order in respect of the Civil Service, under Article 48(4) of the Basic Law, and issued regulations under that Order. ", " These instruments were challenged by the Association of Expatriate Civil Servants. ", " The Basic Law requires that the previous system in respect of public servants 'shall be maintained', and that the appointment and removal of public officers shall be 'in accordance with legal procedures'. ", " It was argued that these requirements had not been satisfied, as the new scheme had not been approved by the Legislative Council. ", " The court rejected the challenge, holding that the previous system was established by executive action and could therefore be maintained in a similar manner. ", " The court did, however, declare that public officers were not bound by one provision which prohibited a public officer under interdiction from leaving Hong Kong without permission. ", " It was held that this was a restriction on the freedom to leave Hong Kong, protected by Article 8(2) of the Bill of Rights, and the restriction was not 'provided by law'. ", " The court therefore declared that holders of public office to whom the Executive Order applies were not bound by that restriction. ", " Human Rights and the Rule of Law ", " What do these court challenges and decisions demonstrate? ", " In my view, they demonstrate that human rights are fully protected in the SAR by an independent Judiciary, and that the rule of law is as strong as ever. ", " Members of the community are able to challenge laws and procedures that they consider to be inconsistent with the ICCPR, or the Basic Law, and in some cases those challenges have been successful. ", " They also demonstrate that the Provisional Legislative Council was lawfully established and that the immigration legislation enacted by it was, with the exception of one provision, lawfully enacted. ", " Challenges ahead ", " What of the future? ", " There are many significant legal challenges ahead. ", " As many of you may know, Article 23 of the Basic Law provides that the Hong Kong SAR shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, or subversion against the Central People's Government. ", " This provision is a reflection of Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy since, even though the offences referred to are offences against the Central People's Government, the SAR is to enact its own legislation in respect of them. ", " In preparing this legislation, the SAR Government will have full regard to the provisions in the ICCPR and the Basic Law concerning freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. ", " It will also take into account public opinion. ", " The proposals will be fully debated by the members of the Legislative Council and will need to be acceptable to them. ", " Another challenge lying ahead is the development of a bilingual legal system in Hong Kong. ", " The foundations for this have already been laid, in that all our Ordinances are bilingual, and all courts are allowed to operate in either the English or Chinese language. ", " A large proportion of cases heard in the magistracies are already conducted in Cantonese. ", " In developing bilingualism, we are determined that the quality of the administration of justice should be maintained. ", " We will continue to develop a body of jurisprudence in respect of the Basic Law.

", " The regulatory controls imposed on these medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres as nursing homes include, among others, the accommodation, staffing and equipment used or to be used in such centres which should be fit for the purposes intended.

", " \"The management and operation of such centres also vary,\" she added. ", " Taking into account these observations, the Government proposes and the Action Committee Against Narcotics supports that a registration scheme should be introduced for non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres, in order to: ", " * ensure drug patients undergo treatment and rehabilitation in a properly managed and secure environment to safeguard their well-being; ", " * protect the rights and welfare of drug patients who, like other drug patients in medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres, are subject to psychological stress and physical health problems when undergoing treatment and rehabilitation. ", " The staff and treatment approaches adopted by these centres should, therefore, be competent/relevant in providing services to them; and ", " * enable the Government to keep a register of the non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres and to impose requirements and standards for their operations as necessary. ", " To ensure broadly the same registration standards to be applied to all drug treatment and rehabilitation centres, Mrs Lo said the proposed registration requirements to be introduced for non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres would be similar to those provisions of Cap.165 which currently apply to medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres. ", " The major registration requirements will include the following: ", " * a person in charge of a drug treatment and rehabilitation centre will need to apply to an authority for registration if the centre provides residential care, treatment and rehabilitation service for drug abusers; ", " * registration of an applicant is subject to the conditions that the drug treatment and rehabilitation centre under application complies with fire safety and building safety requirements as prescribed by the Director of Fire Services and the Director of Buildings respectively (the preliminary requirements have been set out in the consultation document); and ", " * the applicant is fit for operating a drug treatment and rehabilitation centre.

", " The first phase of the registration scheme will cover those non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres which receive subvention from the Social Welfare Department. ", " Other non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres will be covered in a subsequent phase as some of them might wish to seek other sources of funding. ", " As regards the registration procedures, Mrs Lo said all operators of non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres would be required to notify the registration authority of their operation within three months after commencement of the enabling legislation. ", " They will be granted exemption certificates which will provisionally exempt them from registration until such certificates are revoked. ", " For these non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres covered in the first phase, their exemption certificates will be revoked 48 months after the end of the notification period. ", " During this grace period, they are encouraged to obtain a registration certificate from the registration authority as soon as they are ready. ", " If they fail to obtain a registration certificate by the end of the grace period, they will have to cease operation. ", " As regards those non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres set up upon or after the commencement of the enabling legislation, the operator will need to apply for registration before starting to provide such services. ", " Non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres not covered in the first phase will also be granted exemption certificates. ", " The timing of implementation of the registration scheme for them will be decided in the light of experience gained as these centres have their unique circumstances. ", " \"The registration authority for non-medical drug treatment and rehabilitation centres will be the Social Welfare Department.

", " Speaking at the opening of \"1999 Hong Kong and Mainland Conference on Drug Dependence\" at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Mrs Lo added: \"New technology not only has shortened distance, but also greatly increased production of synthetic drugs and enabled them to be transported from one place to another. ", " Drug syndicates have become increasingly internationalized and their operations increasingly complicated. ", " As a result, the challenges facing governments over the world are getting bigger and bigger.\" ", " Briefly introducing the present drug abuse situation in Hong Kong, Mrs Lo said the number of reported drug abusers had been on the decrease since 1995. ", " There were about 16 000 reported drug abusers in 1998, and 5 527 in the first quarter of 1999, representing a drop of 11 per cent compared with the same period in 1998. ", " Hong Kong adopted a multi-proned approach in combating the problems of drug trafficking and drug abuse through law enforcement, international co-operation, treatment and rehabilitation, preventive education and publicity, as well as research, Mrs Lo continued. ", " In law enforcement, Hong Kong had enacted sound legislation to control the supply, manufacture and storage of dangerous drugs and psychotropic substances, and to prevent chemicals from being used for manufacturing dangerous drugs. ", " The Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance enabled the Government to trace, freeze and confiscate drug traffickers' drug proceeds, and spelt out various measures to combat money laundering activities. ", " The Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance was being amended to require money changers and remittance agents to take anti-money laundering measures. ", " Mrs Lo pointed out that Hong Kong adopted a multi-modality approach for treatment and rehabilitation to meet the needs of drug abusers with different backgrounds. ", " \"This year, we'll propose legislation to require treatment and rehabilitation centres providing voluntary residential services to register in order to raise the standard of their services. ", " We are currently reviewing the success of the methadone treatment programme. ", " In the review, we'll explore the feasibility of supplementing or replacing methadone with other drugs,\" she added. ", " Looking ahead, Mrs Lo said that posing a challenge to anti-drug work would be the crisis to be brought about by mass production of synthetic drugs, youngsters abusing psychotropic substances at places of public entertainment and other places,as well as the problems of female drug abusers. ", " Officiating at the opening of the conference, the Hon Dr Rosanna Wong, Member of the Executive Council, said that strengthening liaison and exchanges in anti-drug work between Hong Kong and the Mainland was essential to the long term co-operation in tackling drug problems. ", " \"I believe that anti-drug work and latest developments in the Mainland and Hong Kong can be explored in depth at this conference, and can benefit from your experience for further improvement to existing services and measures,\" she told the participants. ", " Over 200 anti-drug policy administrators, law enforcers, academics and professionals all over China attended the five-day conference, which is the first of its nature and scale held in Hong Kong after the Handover. ", " Participants from China include Mr Yin Dakui, Vice-Minister, Ministry of Health; Mr Shao Mingli, Deputy Secretary General, State Drug Administration; and Mr Wang Kang, Deputy Secretary General, National Narcotics Control Commission.

", " The delegation had exchanged with members of the National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA), Singapore's counterpart of ACAN and officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Central Narcotics Bureau and the Prisons Department. ", " It had also visited various voluntary organisations in the drug field, and private companies which are taking part in a partnership programme with the Singapore Government on drug preventive education. ", " ACAN Chairman, Professor Lee Shiu-hung, who led the delegation, said members observed that the trip had been useful especially in strengthening international cooperation in the anti-drug area. ", " In preventive education and publicity, members were impressed by the Partnership Programme for a Drug-free Singapore. ", " They also reaffirmed the present direction taken by the Narcotics Division in actively involving the community in anti-drug work, and proposed that the Division should align the community more closely, e.g. by inviting advertising companies and the media to contribute to large-scale anti-drug campaigns. ", " Members considered that involving volunteers in spreading anti-drug message was one of the best ways to involve the community. ", " In this regard, Prof. Lee pointed out that the Action Committee Against Narcotics was revamping the Youth Volunteer Group, and would encourage people from different sectors to contribute to anti-drug work. ", " Noting Singapore's badge scheme to encourage students to spread anti-drug messages, members have recommended that the Narcotics Division should consider a similar scheme to pay recognition to students who made significant contribution to the anti-drug cause. ", " For treatment and rehabilitation, members recommended that cross referral between various modalities in Hong Kong should be strengthened. ", " Given the Singapore experience in using \"naltrexone\" in relapse prevention, members suggested that it might be worthwhile for Hong Kong to consider the possibility of launching clinical trial using naltrexone as well as other new drugs in the context of the methadone treatment programme review. ", " Referring to Singapore's aftercare programmes of helping drug addicts to find jobs, members have suggested introducing similar programmes in Hong Kong to strengthen vocational training for drug addicts. ", " They also recommended giving employers some incentives to employ ex-addicts to help the latter reintegrate in the society. ", " In conclusion, members suggested that, due to social and political differences between Singapore and Hong Kong, not all Singapore anti-drug policies and strategies can be directly transplanted to Hong Kong. ", " However, the visit was fruitful and stimulating, and was very beneficial for future planning of anti-narcotic policies in Hong Kong.

", " The assurance was given by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr John Tsang Chun-wah, when addressing a luncheon of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce today (Thursday). ", " Mr Tsang, while outlining Customs work in curbing the rampant piracy activities, said, \"I am very happy to tell you that we have blinded the pirate in the remaining eye. ", " The piracy situation is now under control.\" ", " He noted that the extent of CD piracy in Hong Kong was shrinking rapidly due to the hard work of the largest dedicated professional enforcement unit in the world. ", " \"We take a two pronged enforcement strategy directed at the supply side and the retail end of the pirated CD business in our community,\" he said. ", " The Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance came into force in August last year, requiring CD factories to operate under Customs licence. ", " \"Having been assured of the legitimacy of our licensed factories, our investigation teams would turn to concentrate their energy on the underground plants,\" Mr Tsang noted. ", " He pointed out that since last September, Customs officers had cracked 11 underground CD factories and seized 18 production lines worth some $100 million. ", " \"Without a local source, supply of pirated CDs to the local market now comes mainly from nearby areas, as evident by the upsurge in our interceptions made at the airport, land and marine boundaries,\" he went on. ", " So far this year, Customs officers had intercepted some 800,000 CDs at these boundary points, he noted. ", " \"We are also putting tremendous pressure on pirated CD retail outlets in notorious shopping arcades,\" he said. ", " Apart from the 300 odd officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau, the Department has set up a 185-member Special Task Force to tackle the piracy problem on the street level. ", " The Special Task Force, drawing resources from other Customs formations to make up a 300 strong team on any major outing, launched its first territory-wide anti-piracy operation on June 30, Mr Tsang said. ", " \"Up to the end of August, just in a mere two months' time, some 750 shops have been raided, over 600 people arrested, and two million pirated products seized,\" he added. ", " He noted that due to the heightened enforcement pressure against the sale of pirated CDs, officers of the Special Task Force had encountered increasing resistance by illicit operators. ", " Mr Tsang, however, maintained that the resistance would not affect morale of the officers but helped to strengthen their resolve. ", " Speaking on police involvement in tackling the retail sale of pirated and counterfeit goods, Mr Tsang said Customs had a close working relationship with the Police. ", " \"Joint operations are mounted from time to time with raids at shopping arcades and hawking areas. ", " In addition, the Police and Customs have a standing arrangement of exchanging intelligence on IPR violations on a weekly basis,\" he added. ", " He noted that the use of repeated enforcement actions in the notorious black spots had proved its effectiveness. ", " \"We have now broken the back of the illicit business in the popular areas. ", " Vendors of pirated CDs have been forced out of their mainstream bases to operate underground, or to resort to very short-term leases in long vacated premises. ", " \"We intend to do even more on the legislative side to enhance our enforcement,\" he stressed. ", " The proposals, he cited, included amendments to make unauthorised recordings in cinemas an offence, to broaden the definition of infringing activities to include anything other than those intended for personal and domestic purposes, to incorporate copyright and counterfeiting offences into the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance for the purposes of attracting heavier penalties and forfeiture of monetary proceeds from such illegal activities. ", " \"We are also considering other amendments which will help facilitate enforcement. ", " Obviously, the degree of severity of these measures would have to be acceptable to the public,\" he said. ", " On courts punishment, Mr Tsang said, \"our courts also consider that IPR protection is critical for the protection of our society.\" ", " He added they had handed down heavy sentences to underline their resolve. ", " \"Recent sentences reached as high as 39 months of imprisonment and $1.04 million of fine. ", " Both cases concerned manufacturing of infringing CDs,\" he noted. ", " Turning to the role played by the industry in protecting intellectual property, Mr Tsang emphasized that the success of their strategy rested with the commitment of the industry. ", " Customs was the sole enforcement agent for the statutory offences, he explained, adding that the primary responsibility for the protection of the rights rested invariable with the property rights owners who could take civil litigations against unauthorised exploitation of those rights. ", " \"We maintain our already close working relationship with the industry,\" he said. ", " Customs has been managing the Anti-Piracy Reward Scheme funded by the industry since 1998 and some $1.3 million of reward money has been paid so far for information leading to successful prosecutions. ", " The Commissioner said the industry had been very supportive in general in helping the Department verify the authenticity of the seized CDs and provide the necessary administrative support in criminal prosecution. ", " \"In June this year, we have jointly launched with the Business Software Alliance the Genuine Software Action Campaign to give recognition to organisations with good internal software management,\" he continued. ", " He noted that the programme had generated a great deal of interest in the community. ", " Mr Tsang noted that the piracy problem could not be uprooted by mere stringent enforcement alone. ", " \"Incessant demand from the public will sustain the illicit trade, thereby nullifying the enforcement efforts and bringing irrevocable damage to Hong Kong's economy and reputation,\" he explained. ", " The long-term solution, therefore, rested with education in changing people's mentality, and in raising respect for intellectual property, he concluded.
