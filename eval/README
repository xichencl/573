LING 573 project Deliverable 3

Macklin Blackburn, Xi Chen, Yuan Zhang

Running D3.cmd will train the system and test it on the devtest data. The main system run is carried out by src/main.py. Main_eval.sh calls the system and then the ROUGE evaluation. The first argument of main.py is the json file containing preprocessed gold standard summaries for the training set, the second is the preprocessed training documents, the third is the non-preprocessed test documents, and the fourth is the preprocessed test documents. Currently the system tests on the devtest set.

The system is configured to run in the /home2/mblac6/573/573 directory on patas. To run the evaluation on another system, change the paths in eval/test.xml, eval/main_eval.sh, and src/main.py. The VADER sentiment analysis files in NLTK also need to be downloaded using nltk.download().
