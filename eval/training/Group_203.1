The Hong Kong government has been working to improve care services for the elderly.

Many citizens were concerned about the time that people have spent on waiting lists to enter government-subsidized care homes.  The government responded that it would implement a system by which only those elderly in genuine need of residential care would be eligible to apply. The Social Welfare Department also planned to give additional resources to  homes, so that the elderly would not need to be transferred between different homes.

In the fall of 1999, the government announced it had shortened the waiting time for care homes and commissioned additional homes.
