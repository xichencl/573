Despite a continuing fall in the number of reported drug abuse cases and young drug abusers, the Hong Kong Government is commited towards education, treatment, and rehabilitation programs. Additionally, legislation helps to control the manufacture and distribution of dangerous drugs. And serious efforts by police and customs officials are being taken to target traffickers.


 A research sub-committee of the Action Committee Against Narcotics  commissioned research on treatment and rehabilitation to assist the government and the ACAN in the formulation of anti-drug policies and programs. The government has five strategies to combat drug trafficking and abuse; law enforcement, preventative education and publicity, treatment and rehabilitation, research, and international cooperation.

 The government remains committed to addressing the persistent problems posed by drugs. 

The Action Committee Against Narcotics has commissioned studies that seek the causes of drug abuse, as well as the best treatment.

New publicity measures have also been proposed, along with requiring all drug treatment programs to be licensed.
