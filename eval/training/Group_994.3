To maintain its competitive economic edge, the Hong Kong Government has pledged to promote the development of e-commerce, a growing source for billions of dollars in revenue. The greatest step is in the newly legislated Electronic Transactions Bill, which is intended to give electronic records and digital signatures the same legal status as their paper-based counterparts. It will provide the necessary legal framework and a secure and trusted environment for the conduct of electronic transactions. When enacted, the bill will substantiate the necessary operations of the Certification Authorities (CAs), which authenticates the identity of participants in electronic commerce.
