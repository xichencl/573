Hong Kong has braced itself and it ready for any curve balls that the turn of the century may throw its way.

Many business and organizations have reported a proposed state of total or near readiness.  

In its December issue of the "Year 2000 Bulletin", the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed that it expected that by the end of 1988, 94% of authorized institutions' critical systems would be Y2K compliant and 88% of their non-critical systems would be.

Of all companies and agencies examined, it seems that Customs Clearance and operations was the only organization not at all affected by the Y2K scare.
