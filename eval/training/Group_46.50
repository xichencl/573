The unemployment and underemployment rates during the 1998-99 year have varied.  Both numbers reached lows during the period of February to April 1998.  The unemployment rate reached a high of 6.3% while underemployment got as high as 3.1%.  The government has taken steps to improve the rates.


  Due to increases in the Hong Kong 1998 unemployment rate that occurred mainly in the retail, restaurants and construction sectors, the government initiated a series of measures. Attending these measures were decreases in the unemployment rate, seen mainly in the construction, manufacturing, import/export trades, hotels, transport, real estate and insurance sectors.

 The Asian financial crisis in 1998 created high unemployment rates in Hong Kong. As unemployment rates rose, the Government implemented a wide-ranging series of measures to help the unemployed to rejoin the workforce and equip them with the requisite skills to stay competitive in the labour market.
