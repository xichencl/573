In an effort to bring Hong Kong's legislative control on endangered species in line with CITES, many species were added to the protection list of the Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance. This means that possession, import and export of these species, their parts and derivatives are subjected to licensing control. 
 The Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance protects endangered species through governmental control over the import and export of specified plants and animals. The control measure affects commercial groups, traders, and individuals; it is an offence to import, export or possess endangered species without a licence from the Agriculture and Fisheries Department.
 Endangered species are getting more help from the government. 

More species have been added to the protection list. The government has proposed to extend legislative control on the trade and possession of endangered species.  Further, the AFD warned the public not to bring items of endangered species as suveniers when they travel.
