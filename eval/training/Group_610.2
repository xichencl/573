The Government of Hong Kong was to appeal the decision of the Court of First Instance.  This decision extended right of abode (ROA) to persons of Chinese nationality born outside of Hong Kong, who at the date of their birth had parents neither of whom were permanent residents and one of whom subsequently acquired that status.  This decision was finalized on by the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  The CFA also ruled that these persons could enter Hong Kong for settlement without approval from Mainland authorities.

Other important court decisions include Immigration (Amendment)(No.5) Bill 1997.
