The Housing Authority's Home Ownership Committee (HOC) has relaxed many restrictions on flat purchase and rental. One is that the resale restriction period for Home Ownership Scheme (HOS)/Private Sector Participation Scheme flats is shortened to enhance the attractiveness of HOS and promote mobility of flats, both in the open market and the secondary HOS market, and will also allow more rental flats to be recovered for allocation to needy families. The HOC is also opening up HOS flat availability to single persons, for small flats; this was later relaxed to allow singles to purchase larger flats in buildings where all families have already chosen.
