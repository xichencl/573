The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee approves grants to aid flood victims.
Between the months of July and November of 1998, many grants were sent for emergency relief. Grants were sent to the Mainland, North Korea, and Bangladesh. North Korea has suffered continued hardship brought about by floods and droughts over the past few years. Bangladesh and the Mainland have been affected by recent flooding.
The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee has given grants to United Nations Children's Fund, Medicins Sans Frontieres, and Salvation Army, hoping that the grants can help to provide some immediate relief to the victims affected by the recent floods.
