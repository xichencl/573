Widespread existence of unlicensed food vendors has caused the Urban Services Department (USD) to step up law enforcement action against them.  Steps taken include increasing the frequency of inspections to restaurants and food premises and stepping up prosecution actions against irregularities found on these premises.

The USD is trying to bring these vendors to court on chardes of operating unlicensed food factories and exposing food to risk of contamination.  The maximum penalty for operating unlicensed food premises is a $50,000 fine and six months imprisonment with a $900 per day fine.

Also involved in attempting to eliminate the existence of these unlicensed food factories is the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD).  The FEHD launched several sting operations in and around Mong Kok.  One of these stings resulted inthe arrest of six operators.  Also recovered from the operation was 93 kilograms of cooked food which was possibly exposed to contamination.  Another raid mounted earlier in Mong Kok, resulted in the arrest of 21 operators. 

The seizures are legal under Secion 59 of the Public Heath and Municipal Services Ordinance, Cap 132. The FEHD hopes to put an end to these illegal operations to help protect puclic health and safety.


  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) along with the Urban Services Department, in an effort to stem cholera and safeguard public health, have mounted blitz operations against unlicensed food factories selling snacks and cooked food in Mong Kok district. There has been a proliferation of these small scale food factories that sell snacks and cooked food, specifically, shellfish, non-bottled drinks and Siu Mei and Lo Mei, in sub-divided shop units. Most of these premises are not qualified for a food licence and their hygiene standards are poor, often storing food in open spaces and preparing food on the pavement in front of these shops. 

 Both agencies have reacted strongly. Summary arrests launced in urban blackspots between November 25 and 27 resulted in the arrest of twelve operators for running unlicensed food premises and three for breaching a prohibition order. Moreover, a total of 80 kilograms of cooked food exposed to risk of contamination were also seized for disposal under Section 59 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance, Cap 132.

 Under the Food Business (Urban Council) By-laws, the maximum penalty for operating unlicensed food premises is a fine of $50,000, an imprisonment of six months and a daily fine of $900.
 The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and Urban Services Department have been active in shutting down unlicensed food vendors.  These vendors are likely to be a threat to public health due to unsanitary conditions of food preparation and storage.

Recently, there has been an increase in the number of small food factories selling snacks and cooked food.  The conditions of most of these places are not sanitary, and prosecution action is usually difficult because the vendors' tenancies at these locations are short.  In order to speed up prosecution of the proprietors of these food vendors, arrest actions were taken in addition to normal prosecution.  In 1999, a total of 243 summonses were issued to unlicensed food vendors in the Mong Kok district of Hong Kong.

In the Food Business Regulation, it is stated that those in the food business cannot leave food open to contamination or wrap the food in unclean material.  Vendors are reminded that the maximum penalty for operating unlicensed food premises is $50,000 and six months in prison, along with a daily fine of $900.  In the face of health risks such as the spread of cholera, the government pledges to continue its efforts to ensure the health of the public.
