The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and Urban Services Department have been active in shutting down unlicensed food vendors.  These vendors are likely to be a threat to public health due to unsanitary conditions of food preparation.

In order to speed up prosecution of the proprietors of these food vendors, arrest actions were taken in addition to normal prosecution.

In the Food Business Regulation, it is stated that those in the food business cannot leave food open to contamination or wrap the food in unclean material.  In the face of diseases such as cholera, the prosecution of unlicensed food vendors is important.
