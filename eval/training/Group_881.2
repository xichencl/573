The Hong Kong government is continuing to crack down on the production of pirated optical discs. 

During anti-piracy raids, Customs officers, acting on intelligence information, smash the production site and detain the individuals responsible.  Among the items seized have been video CDs, music CDs, game discs, CD-Roms, Japanese TV dramas, and obscene materials.  Pirated optical discs have also been seized at the airport and seaports.  These discs are smuggled into Hong Kong from Malaysia, Singapore, and Macau. 

The public are reminded that the Copyright Ordinance gives a heavy penalty to anyone found importing or selling pirated items.
