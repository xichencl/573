 Most ferry services were provided by Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Co.Ltd. (HYF) and Hong Kong Kowloon Ferry Company (HKK) until March 31, 1999 when New World First Ferry Services Ltd. (NWFF) took over all HYF routes.  
 In 1998 the Trasport Department announced that licenses to operate various ferry routes would be awarded to Discovery Bay Transportation, HKK, and HYF. The licenses were for a period of three years, and were given based on a tender exercise,designed to let market forces determine the viability, fare and service levels. The TD received eight bids from six companies when the tender closed on November 20.





 As a result of tendering out the ferry services as eight separate packages, the current franchise by the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) will terminate on March 31, 1999, and the outlying island, new town and inner harbour ferry services as well as "Star" Ferry's Central - Hung Hom service will be operated as licensed services by five ferry operators: HYF, "Star" Ferry, Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry Company Limited (HKK), Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited (DBTSL) and Shun Tak Ferries Limited. The multiple franchises leads to enhanced competition and helps the Transport Department contract the most suitable ferry service operators.


 There have been several changes in public transportation, specifically with regards to ferries.

Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) had contracts to operate several different ferry routes through the end of March 1999.  The Transportation Department (TD) in late 1998, invited operators to bid for these and other routes. Many changes in management resulted.

The objective of the tender exercise is to let market forces determine their viability, fare and service levels.

In addition to changes in management, there were also some fare changes.  The new licenses took effect in April 1999, the fare changes in April 2000.  most of them were increases.
