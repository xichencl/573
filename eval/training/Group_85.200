As a result of tendering out the ferry services as eight separate packages, the current franchise by the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) will terminate on March 31, 1999, and the outlying island, new town and inner harbour ferry services as well as "Star" Ferry's Central - Hung Hom service will be operated as licensed services by five ferry operators: HYF, "Star" Ferry, Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry Company Limited (HKK), Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited (DBTSL) and Shun Tak Ferries Limited. The new franchises will last three years. Most services will see an increase in trips, with the exception of the North Point - Kwun Tong service, which will be cancelled due to a lack of bidder and low ridership. The multiple franchises leads to enhanced competition (which grants reasonable or even reduced fares to passengers) and helps the Transport Department contract the most suitable ferry service operators. Due to changes in fares, schedules, and departure locations, passengers are reminded to check their travel plans carefully against the new schedules. In 2000, HYF transferred its franchise to New World First Ferry Services Ltd. (NWFF), with an increase in fares, albeit without any change to the current schedules.


 There have been several changes in public transportation, specifically with regards to ferries.

Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) had contracts to operate several different ferry routes through the end of March 1999.  The Transportation Department (TD) in late 1998, invited operators to indicate their interest in possibly taking over these and other routes.  TD received eight bids from six tenderers for the license to operate new town/inner harbor routes.

The objective of the tender exercise is to let market forces determine their viability, fare and service levels.

The chief executive approved a new franchise for Star Ferry giving the Company the right to operate the Central - Tsim Sha Tsui route and the Wan Chai - Tsim Sha Tsui route for ten years, and the Central - Hung Hom route for one year.

TD granted inner harbor ferry licenses to Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited, Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF)and "Star" Ferry Company Limited for a period of three years, from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2002.

In addition to changes in management, there were also some fare changes.  The new licenses took effect in April 1999, the fare changes in April 2000.  most of them were increases.
  In Hong Kong, ferries provide an essential link to the outlying islands where land transport alternatives are not available. They also provide a useful alternative in relieving pressure on the road system between Central and the new towns. In the inner harbour, ferries play a supplementary role.
 Most ferry services were provided by Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Co.Ltd. (HYF) and Hong Kong Kowloon Ferry Company (HKK) until March 31, 1999 when New World First Ferry Services Ltd. (NWFF) took over all HYF routes. To facilitate a smooth transition, the Transport Department activated a special Operation Coordination Centre (OCC) at its headquarters from 6 pm tomorrow to 9 am the next morning and from 4 pm to 8 pm on April 1, 1999. The coordination centre was to maintain a close liaison with ferry operators and government departments.
  In 1998 the Transport Department announced that licenses to operate various ferry routes would be awarded to Discovery Bay Transportation, HKK, and HYF. The licenses were for a period of three years, and were given based on a tender exercise,designed to let market forces determine the viability, fare and service levels. The TD received eight bids from six companies when the tender closed on November 20.
