In order to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights, Customs officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau are leading intensive investigations into possible piracy operations, often resulting in the seizure of pirated material or the smashing of pirated material storage centers or notorious retail shops.

Anti-piracy action takes on several forms. Customs officials examine cargo at the airport and raid industrial buildings.

According to the Copyright Ordinance, anyone who was found importing or selling any pirated articles is liable to prosecution. The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $50,000 per disc and four years' imprisonment.
