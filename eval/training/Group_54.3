In an effort to curb illegal immigration, the Police, Immigration Department and Labour Department have set up many anti-immigration operations.

Security checkpoints were set up in many public places as well as locations that were suspected of being high traffic areas for illegal immigrants.  At the security checkpoints, the police checked identification cards of an average of 20,000 people.  Operations at these checkpoints usually resulted in 50 to 200 arrests.  Among the arrested were illegal immigrants, overstayers, legal residents who had breached their condition of stay and legal residents who had helped in harboring or employed illegal immigrants.
