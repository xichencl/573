Through its good work, the Customs and Excise Department contributes significantly to law and order in society and the economic well-being of Hong Kong. It is committed to the enforcement of 48 different pieces of legislation, which includes the protection of revenue on dutiable commodities, the detection of drug trafficking and smuggling, the protection of intellectual property rights and consumer interests, the exercise of import and export controls as well as customs clearance of travellers and goods. The Department has been repeatedly praised for its excellance in discharging these duties, and its professionalism, dedication, and efficiency. The fine balance that it has maintained between law enforcement and trade facilitation has enhanced competitiveness and strengthened Hong Kong's position as one of the finest commercial centres in the world. More importantly, the Department has proven to the world through its unrelenting boundary control, active participation in  international customs activites and support of international customs cooperation. It also has sustained efforts to maintain its independence and autonomy in the control of strategic commodities that Hong Kong remains a separate customs territory after its return to China, and that the concept of "one country, two systems" has been implemented successfully in Hong Kong.

 The Hong Kong Customs and Excise department has received much praise for doing good work.  While inspecting the department's review to mark its 90th anniversary at the training school in Tuen Mun, the chief executive, Mr. Tung Chee Hwa lauded Customs for their contributions to the betterment of society.  Customs commissioner, Mr. John Tsang Chun-wah said that customs has been playing an important part in implementing the "one country, two systems" concept in Hong Kong.

One of Customs' main concerns is the protection of intellectual property rights and the maintenance of Hong Kong as a pirate-free zone.  This is important as Hong Kong seeks to increase its investment in technology.  In one month, Customs officers had busted 11 underground CD factories and seized 18 production lines worth about $100 million.  This was done with the help of a 300-member Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau and a 185-member Special Task force street team.

Also of concern is the protection of the integrity of the department.  Customs' constantly reviews its work procedures to minimize chances of corruption.

Hong Kong Customs does not work completely independently;  The department has signed a Customs Cooperative arrangement aimed at strengthening its relationship with the Customs General Administration of  China.


  The Chief Executive, Mr Tung Chee Hwa,in September '99 noted that the Hong Kong Customs Department had taken vigorous actions against rights infringement activities and had established close links with mainland international law enforcement authorities as well as the relevant authorities to protect intellectual property rights.
 He noted that the Department had proven to the world through its unrelenting boundary control and active participation in the international customs arena that Hong Kong remained a separate customs territory after its return to China, and that the concept of "one country, two systems" had been implemented successfully in Hong Kong.

"With the approach of the 21st Century, we commit ourselves to developing Hong Kong into a centre of innovation and technology," Mr Tung went on.

 Over the past nine decades, Hong Kong has transformed itself from a seaport into a leading international commercial centre. The Department has also undergone considerable expansion in both its establishment and scope of responsibilities. With an establishment of 5,200 strong staff members, the Customs and Excise Department is now a major Department under the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, committed to the enforcement of 48 different pieces of legislation.
