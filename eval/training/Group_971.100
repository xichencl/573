There were other busts.  The ages of the suspect were all between 20 and 50 years.  The amount of heroin found during each seizure was as small as 250 grams but not larger than 10 kilograms.

  The Chineese government, specifically the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau and the Narcotics Bureau, have been engaged in various fforts to stem the heroin trade. There were a number of arrests of individuals, neutralisation of various centrse for drug manufacturing, and prevention of influx of drugs into the country. 

  For example, 44-year-old man arrested by Customs Drug Investigation Bureau appeared in Kwun Tong Magistracy on April 28, 2000 charged with trafficking in a dangerous drug and manufacturing a dangerous drug. The suspect was arrested by the officers yesterday in Lam Tin following the seizure of 820 grams of No. 4 heroin worth about $500,000.




 One branch of the Customs and Excise Department is the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau. Along with the Narcotics Bureau, they seek to eradicate dealing in narcotics. One of their biggest targets is heroin trade, smuggling, manufacture, and distribution. By tracking suspicious persons and setting ambushes, many drug manufacturing centres have been uncovers and smashed. Police have also made seizures off private persons, in particular intercepting smugglers at airports and customs control points. There has been an increase in successful seizures, and the amount of heroin seized in Hong Kong has risen by 100 kilograms in the past year, without an increase in drug demand.
