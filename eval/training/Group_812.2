The Management Board of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority endorsed at its meeting the MPFA Corporate Plan 2000-2001 and proposed amendments to the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Regulation. Programmes and activities outlined in the MPFA Corporate Plan were constructed with the mission and target of the MPFA in mind. "Our mission is to ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's workforce and our target is to implement the MPF System in December. Everybody in the MPFA is devoted to work towards this mission and target," said  Charles Lee Yeh-kwong. The commencement date for MPF contributions should remain unchanged.
