The Young Athletes Training Scheme is a program which is aimed at nurturing young athletes and enhancing sports training at district level. Co-organized by the Provisional Regional Council and various sports organizations, the scheme encourages younths to train their skills in five popular sports: swimming, football, basketball, table-tennis, and badminton. Training is available to young people aged between 8 and 15, depending on the sport, and applicants must go through screening tests on their basic skills of the sport before they can receive formal training. The training classes are given by professional coaches from each sport. Athletes with potential will be referred to the respective association for further training. Outstanding trainees might be selected to the local youth representative teams and even be given the chance to go on and represent Honk Kong in international competitions as well. Most of the programs are conducted in multi-year phases, with a fee for each class or phase.

Application forms are available at all district offices of the Regional Services Department and the relevant sports associations.
