The Hong Kong Customs and Excise department has received much praise for doing good work.

One of Customs' main concerns is the protection of intellectual property rights and the maintenance of Hong Kong as a pirate-free zone.  Also of concern is the protection of the integrity of the department.

  Hong Kong Customs has taken vigorous actions against rights infringement activities and has established close links with mainland international law enforcement authorities as well as the relevant authorities to protect intellectual property rights. The Department, through its unrelenting boundary control and active participation in the international customs arena, has remained a separate territory.
 The Customs and Excise Department contributes significantly to law and order in society and the economic well-being of Hong Kong. The Department has been repeatedly praised for its excellance in discharging these duties with professionalism and dedication. Its good work has also made Hong Kong one of the finest commercial centres in the world.
