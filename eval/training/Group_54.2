 A Hong Kong operation against illegal immigration jointly mounted by the Police, Immigration Department and Labour Department has resulted in the arrests of 202 people. The operation is part of the Government's effort to flush out illegal immigrants. All the arrested illegal immigrants were referred to the Immigration Department. Those found to be illegal immigrants will be repatriated. 
 On the labour front, inspectors of the Labour Department visited 3,148 establishments to weed out any illegal immigrants who may be working there and to check that employers fulfil their legal obligation of keeping proper records. 
 This is just one instance of the ongoing policy.
