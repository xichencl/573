Officials in Hong Kong, through visits and meetings, are attempting to make stronger ties with the Mainland.

The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mrs. Anson Chan, visited Beijing.  During her stay in Beijing Mrs. Chan exchanged views with the Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Liao, on subjects of mutual concern to Hong Kong and the Mainland, with hopes of strengthening ties and cooperation.  On her visit, she also met with Vice-Premier Qian Qichen at Diaoytai State Guesthouse.

Other visits to Beijing include a trip to be taken by the secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Mr. Michael Suen, who will have working meetings with mainland officials on issues of mutual concern.  The Financial Secretary, Mr. Donald Tsang, will visit Beijing to make courtesy calls to the Vice-Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs and meet with bank officials to discuss financial matters. A ten-member delegation of the immigration Department will also visit the Mainland to help promote a better working relationship with Mainland Authorities.

The Secretary for Security, Mrs. Regina Ip, also took a week-long visit to Beijing and Guangzhou to hold talks with Mainland authorities on rendition and to pay courtesy calls to the some state agencies.

 Official representatives of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have made several important and ground-breaking visits with senior officials in Beijing to discuss subjects of mutual concern between the central government of the People's Republic of China and the SAR. Through a frank and open exchange of views, HKSAR officials hope to enhance the communication and understanding between the two governments and accomodate a smooth relationship after the Handover. Both sides acknowledged that given the immense differences in the legal and judicial systems in the Mainland and the HKSAR, the subject is very complicated. The Secretary for Security, Mrs Regina Ip, and the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mrs Anson Chang, are working toward more formal agreements, but under the "one country, two systems" principle, it was agreed that Hong Kong would continue to run its own affairs through a practicable option of arrangement. Views expressed by the public and legislators will also be taken into account. Officials who have paid visits include the Secretary for Security, the Secretary for Justice, the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, the Financial Secretary, and the Director of Immigration. These officials also paid courtesy calls on relevant minstries and state agencies.

  British abdication of control of Hong Kong to China presents a rather peculiar situation. Essentially there now exists one country but two legal and cultural systems. In efforts to smooth the transition and talk about rendition there have been numerous dialogues between the two. 
 For instance, the Secretary for Security, Mrs. Regina Ip, has held useful and positive discussions with the Mainland authorities on rendition during her stay in Beijing. The purpose of the visit was to hold exploratory discussions with the Mainland authorities on rendition and to pay courtesy calls on the relevant ministries and state agencies. "The two sides have exchanged their preliminary views on rendition. Both sides agree that there is a need to put in place a formal arrangement as soon as possible," Mrs Ip said. 
 Also, at the invitation of the Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office of the State Council, Mr Liao Hui, the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mrs Anson Chan, visited Beijing in January 1998. This was the Secretary's first visit since the establishment of the Special Administrative Region Government. During her stay in Beijing, Mrs. Chan exchanged views with Mr. Liao on subjects of mutual concern to Hong Kong and the Mainland.
