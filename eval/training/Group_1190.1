The Department of Health has introduced a surveillance system to monitor hand-foot-mouth diesease, a manifestation of Enterovirus 71.  In order to prevent the spread of this virus, the government of Hong Kong urges citizens to practice good hygiene.  

The surveillance system had success in stopping the spread of Enterovirus 71, with the first fatal case of hand-foot-mouth disease occurring eleven months later.  An Interdepartmental Working Group has also been formed to coordinate measures for the prevention and control of Enterovirus 71.  The public are advised to wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet or handling diapers.
