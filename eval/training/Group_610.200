 The Executive Council of Hong Kong endorsed the Immigration Bill 1997 to the Provisional Legislative Council. The Bill provides that children who claim the right to abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must produce proof of their right by way of a Certificate of Entitlement affixed to their proof of identity. The Scheme seeks to provide an effective channel for the orderly arrival of children, mainly from the Mainland, claiming the ROA.
 The legality of the COE's scheme was upheld by a judgement of the Court of Appeals. "We are also pleased that the retrospectivity aspect of the C of E Scheme was generally endorsed. We however need to study carefully the implications of the judgement that the provision cannot be applied to cases prior to July 1, 1997 before we decide whether we should appeal against this specific aspect of the judgement," a spokesman said.
 The COE is in response to the reunification of Hong Kong and China. Due to a law already in place many mainland children have a right they did not formerly possess. If all these children arrived in Hong Kong at once, the impact on the social support services would be difficult to bear.


 The Government of Hong Kong was to appeal the decision of the Court of First Instance.  This decision extended the right of abode (ROA) to persons of Chinese nationality born outside of Hong Kong, who at the date of their birth had parents neither of whom were permanent residents and one of whom subsequently acquired that status.  This decision was finalized on January 29, 1999 by the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  The CFA also ruled that these persons could enter Hong Kong for settlement without the approval of the Mainland authorities.

Several different people gave speeches that addressed decision of the CFA including the Secretaries for Security, Mrs. Regina Ip and Mr. Peter Lai, Secretary for Justice and Ms. Elsie Leung.  Ms. Leung gave speeches at the International Bar Association Conference on the worldwide application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a Symposium on  "The Implementation and Prospects of 'One Country, Two Systems'" in Commemoration of the 9th Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Basic Law and at the Credit Suisse first Boston Asian Investment Conference.

Other important court decisions include Immigration (Amendment)(No.5) Bill 1997.



 The judgments of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) delivered on 29 January 1999 have extended the eligibility for the right of abode (ROA) of persons born in the Mainland of Hong Kong permanent residents beyond that previously provided for in the Immigration Ordinance. The CFA also ruled that these persons could enter Hong Kong for settlement without the approval of the Mainland authorities. In its judgments, the CFA decided that certain provisions in two previous ROA Ordinances were inconsistent with the Basic Law. These rulings place a great deal of pressure on HKSAR: previously, the number of people that would be eligible would have been about 200,000, but with the ruling, this increases to over a million people. The ROA issue is the most serious question HKSAR has ever encountered since its establishment. The ROA issue is also the most important and fundamental issue of Hong Kong society, for it relates to the people's fundamental rights and to the number of people eligible for becoming permanent residents. To reprehend the situation, a motion has been made to appeal to the NPCSC for an interpretation of Basic Law and to find a resolution.
