Control measures on the avian flu were declared effective by experts for the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No new cases of influenza A H5N1 occured in Hong Kong for almost a year. World health scientists and experts on influenza applauded the action taken by the Hong Kong Government in December 1997, saying that it might have saved the world from an influenza pandemic.
One action taken was a mass poultry slaughter because the primary mode of transmission of the infection was from poultry to man. Human to human transmission of the virus has not been proven.



 Hong Kong has been responding to the problem of avian influenza through a surveillance system and maintaining public health.

As of late 1998, the influenza programs undertaken by the government had resulted in the absence of any new cases for a year.  Part of the government's action was an influenza surveillance, which had been extended to all public hospitals and outpatient clinics. 

Scientists have discovered that the primary mode of transmission of avian flu is from poultry to humans, rather than from human to human.  The public are reminded to help prevent the spread of avian flu through good hygiene.
 Following confirmed cases of several different strains of the influenza virus, Government health officials have been on guard.  The influenza H3N2 virus isolated from a 10 month-old girl who was treated at Tuen Mun Hospital for fever and influenza like illness last month was of swine origin.  Other strains include influenza A H5N1, which has occurred in Hong Kong for almost a year, and influenza A H9N2, both primarily transmitted from birds or ducks, and therefore called the avian flu.

While the modes of transmission require more study, it seems for both types the human to human transmission rate remains low.
