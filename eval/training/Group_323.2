Hong Kong Customs is cracking down on the production of pirated optical discs.  Customs officers have made a series of seizures of illegally produced optical discs.

Surveillance activities often reveal the offending actions, after which police intercept the individuals involved and seize production lines.  Officers have also seized pirated discs at the airport and seaports.

Among the illegal goods seized are CD-Roms, television dramas, and obscene material.  Copyright laws state that anyone found selling or importing pirated material may be prosecuted, with a maximum penalty of $50,000 and four years' imprisonment.  The Hong Kong government has a commitment to intellectual property rights.
