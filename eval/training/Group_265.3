After the outbreak of several isolated cholera cases, the Department of Health (DH) issued warnings to the public to be on guard against the food-borne disease.

The cases reported included men and women of different ages.  The most cases occurred in people over fifty year old.  The most commonly shown symptom of the disease is diarrhea.There were no reports that indicated the development of an epidemic and most infected people were isolated during the incubation period.

The DH issued a list of suggestions for the prevention of cholera and other gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases.  Most of the list involved practicing good hygiene.
