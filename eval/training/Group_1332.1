Customs officials are continuing to crack down on the production of pirated optical discs.

During raids, officers act on information obtained from investigations, stopping production units and seizing the pirated goods.  Among the goods that have been seized are CD Roms, music CDs, and video games.

Seizure of pirated discs has also been carried out at airports and seaports.  Smuggled optical discs have been discovered coming into Hong Kong from surrounding nations.

The government reminds the public that the maximum penalty for selling pirated items is a fine of $50,000 per disc and four years in prison.
