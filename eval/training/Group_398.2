Hong Kong has been responding to the problem of avian influenza through a surveillance system and maintaining public health.

As of late 1998, the influenza programs undertaken by the government had resulted in the absence of any new cases for a year.  Part of the government's action was an influenza surveillance, which had been extended to all public hospitals and outpatient clinics. 

Scientists have discovered that the primary mode of transmission of avian flu is from poultry to humans, rather than from human to human.  The public are reminded to help prevent the spread of avian flu through good hygiene.
