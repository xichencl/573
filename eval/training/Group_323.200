In order to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights, Customs officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau are leading intensive investigations into possible piracy operations, often resulting in the seizure of pirated material or the smashing of pirated material storage centers or notorious retail shops.

The majority of these illegal activities involve pirated optical dics. These range from VCDS -- often of Japanese TV drama series, DVDs, CD Roms, and music CDs.

According to a spokesperson for the Customs and Excise Department, Customs officials would continue their enforcement actions in combating piracy activities, and preserving the good image of Hong Kong.

Anti-piracy action takes on several forms. Customs officials at the airport will examine cargo declared to contain blank recordable discs. Often, these discs are really pirated articles. In addition, Customs officials will raid premises of industrial buildings or disc manufacturing centers targeted in investigations. These raids often result in the seizure of thousands of pirated discs and the arrest of people involved.

According to the Copyright Ordinance, anyone who was found importing or selling any pirated articles is liable to prosecution. The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $50,000 per disc and four years' imprisonment.

Customs officers conduct series of anti-piracy operations. These involve intensive investigations and surveillance operations, and follow-up raids. They are at airports and  sea ports trying to eliminate the smuggling of pirated discs into the country. In Hong Kong, customs smashes pirated disc storage and distribution centers as well as notorius shops selling pirated optical discs in shopping arcades.  They then seize the discs and paraphernalia which leads to the cessation of the businesses.  They also make arrests during their seizures.
Customs spokesmen appeal to members of the public to continue providing information on any suspected piracy activities, which can be accomplished by calling the 24-hour hotline. 
A spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department said, "Our on-going anti-piracy operations signify the determination of the HKSAR Government in the protection of intellectual property rights."

 Hong Kong Customs is cracking down on the production of pirated optical discs.  Customs officers have made a series of seizures of illegally produced optical discs, helping to strengthen Hong Kong's commitment to intellectual property rights.

Customs officers frequently raid locations where illegal optical disc production takes place.  As of November 1998, customs officers had smashed 15 disc factories, recovering a sum of 460 million dollars.  Surveillance activities often reveal the offending actions, after which police intercept the individuals involved and seize production lines.  Series of planned crackdowns on illegal production are given code names such as "Terminator" and "Thunderbolt".

Officers have also seized pirated discs at the airport and seaports.  Smuggled discs have been found shipped from Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Macau.

Among the illegal goods that have been seized are VCDs, MCDs, DVDs, and CD-ROMs that contain music, Japanese television dramas, and obscene material.  Copyright laws state that anyone found selling or importing pirated material may be prosecuted, with a maximum penalty of 50,000 dollars and four years in prison.  The Hong Kong government wants to reinforce its commitment to intellectual property rights, and the Customs Department's ongoing raids of illegal optical disc production support this commitment.
