Widespread existence of unlicensed food vendors has caused the Urban Services Department (USD) to step up law enforcement action against them.  Steps taken include increasing the frequency of inspections to restaurants and stepping up prosecution actions against irregularities found on these premises.
 
Also involved in attempting to eliminate the existence of these unlicensed food factories is the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD).  The FEHD launched several sting operations in and around Mong Kok.  One of these stings resulted inthe arrest of six operators.  Also recovered from the operation was 93 kilograms of cooked food which was possibly exposed to contamination.
