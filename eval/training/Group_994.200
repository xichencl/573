Hong Kong has taken note of the growth of the internet and e-commerce.  Deciding that involvement in e-commerce is essential to keeping afloat in the world economy, the country has has taken steps to integrate electronic transactions into the operation of its government and businesses.

In a luncheon speech, the Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting, Mr. K.C. Kwong expressed the importance of e-commerce and outlined steps towards integrating it into existing government and business systems.

The Electronic Transactions Bill was introduced with the intention of providing a clear legal framework to promote the wide adoption of e-transactions in Hong Kong.  The bill proposes to give digital signatures the same status at their paper-based counterparts.

To protect consumer interests and enhance users' confidence in electronic transactions, the Government will set up a Certification Authority (CA) Recognition Office towards the end of 1999.  The CA will run a system of electronic identification enabling users to do business over the internet and other electronic means.  This program is just one part of the "Digital 21" Information Technology Strategy developed by the Hong Kong Social Administrative Region  Government.  A major thrust of this strategy is to enhance the information infrastructure of Hong Kong.


 To maintain its competitive economic edge, the Hong Kong Government has pledged to promote the development of e-commerce, a growing source for billions of dollars in revenue. The greatest step is in the newly legislated Electronic Transactions Bill, which is intended to give electronic records and digital signatures the same legal status as their paper-based counterparts. It will provide the necessary legal framework and a secure and trusted environment for the conduct of electronic transactions. When enacted, the bill will substantiate the necessary operations of the Certification Authorities (CAs), which authenticates the identity of participants in electronic commerce. Hongkong Post has been designated as the first CA. The bill also provides for the establishment of a Certification Authority Recognition Office, which will grant recognition to CAs in the private sector, oversee revocation and suspension of CAs recognition certificates, and insure compliance with a code of practice. To launch e-commerce, the Government will implement the Electronic Services Delivery (ESD), which will allow citizens to have access to various government services and public agencies online, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This scheme would act as a catalyst to prime the development of electronic commerce in the private sector.

 The development of electronic commerce is necessary for Hong Kong's success in the future.  To help this new technology develop, the government is taking the lead in ensuring that the public accepts electronic commerce as a valid way to make transactions.

The primary concern about the growth of electronic commerce is the safety of making transactions on the internet.  The Hongkong Post plans to establish a public key infrastructure.  This will entail digital signatures and certificates, so that businesses will be able to identify and confirm the parties making an electronic transaction.

The government also plans to give digital signatures used for electronic transactions the same legal status as signatures on paper.  However, certain highly important documents, such as wills, affidavits, and warrants, will be exempt from this new equal status.

Also, the government plans to establish a Certification Authority Recognition Office to run a system of electronic identifications, so that electronic commerce can be conducted.  Although the Hongkong Post will be the first Certification Authority, the private sector will be free to establish new CAs as demand increases.

In 1999, the number of internet users in Hong Kong reached the one million mark. The number of users making online purchases also increased sharply.
