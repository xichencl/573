Hong Kong is facing the realization that while drug abuse in Hong Kong seems to be falling, trafficking in illicit drugs and related organized crimes is still one of the major challenges facing the world today. To combat the increasingly internationalized and complicated operations of drug syndicates, the Hong Kong government has adopted a multi-pronged approach towards combatting drug trafficking and drug abuse.

Law enforcement has sound legislation backing its efforts to control the supply, manufacture, and storage of dangerous drugs. And serious efforts by police and customs officials are being taken to target traffickers.

Hong Kong is also commited towards education as well as treatment and rehabilitation programs. Despite a continuing fall in the number of reported drug abuse cases and young drug abusers in Hong Kong, the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) Research Sub-committee will commission research on treatment and rehabilitation for drug abusers in order to assist the Government and ACAN in studying various aspects of drug abuse and the formulation of anti-drug policies and programmes. In addition, several initiative are being implemented to educate the public on the consequences of abusing drugs, increase community support and involvement programs, and help addicts in several stages of rehabilitation.



 A research sub-committee of the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) commissioned research on treatment and rehabilitation to assist the government and the ACAN in the formulation of anti-drug policies and programs. The government has five strategies to combat drug trafficking and abuse; law enforcement, preventative education and publicity, treatment and rehabilitation, research, and international cooperation. Despite a reported fall in the number of drug abusers in first half of 1999 the government is still working with non-government organizations in the anti-drug field, strengthening efforts in fighting drug problems with greater involvement in community. Hong Kong has seen a decline in the number of drug abusers since 1995, however, psychotropic substances abusers are on the rise. Mrs. Claire Lo, the Commissioner for Narcotics, reports that in 1999, the number of drug abusers is still declining. The Beat Drugs Fund supports anti-drug projects. In 1998 it gave priority to programs for youths at risk and families of abusers.  As drug abuse decreases, organized crime is still a challenge in combating drug-trafficking. For this reason, the ACAN visited Singapore to strengthen international cooperation in the anti-drug area. Locally, the government is introducing schemes requiring registration of drug treatment centers, both medical and non-medical.



 There has been a general decline in drug abuse over the past few years in Hong Kong.  However, the government remains committed to addressing the persistent problems posed by drugs.  The government has commissioned studies, maintained education programs, and closely monitored drug treatment programs to deal with this issue.

The Action Committee Against Narcotics has commissioned studies on the treatment of drug abusers.  The studies seek to illuminate the cause of chronic drug abuse and relapse after treatment, as well as the best motivational strategy for use during treatment.  The committee also visited Singapore to glean ideas for drug policy, such as Singapore's vocational programs for drug addicts.

To educate the public on the hazards of drugs, the ACAN has proposed a drug information center, which would include exhibits and information on drugs.  The government has allocated funds to provide education programs to young people, update anti-drug videos, and maintain publicity programs in electronic and print media.  Special attention will be paid to youths at risk.

The government also plans to require anyone running a drug treatment or rehabilitation program to apply for registration. The government wishes to ensure safety, as well as create a uniform standard for drug treatment.
