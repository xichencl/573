Several dialogues between the Legislative Council and various secretaries including Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands, Secretary for the Environment and Food, Secretary for Health and Welfare; as well as statements made to the press by the Government Land Trasport Agency outline various programs aimed at reducing the amount of air-pollution.


 To improve local air quality, the Hong Kong government is helping promote fuel efficiency and reduction of emissions from both cars and industry.

The government is planning to offer grants to vehicle owners to use efficent fuels.

Also, natural gas is now required for power generation.  The government is educating the public on pollution.


 Following a rise in air pollution levels in Hong Kong last winter, several notable inquiries were made regarding the assesment and plan of action of the Government.  The reply cited the tightening of emission standards and the use of alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, emphasizing their commitment to the common goal.
