In light of a clear need for educational reform, the Chief Executive has asked the Education Commission (EC) to begin a thorough review of the structure of pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary education, addressing the age at which students should begin each stage of education, the duration and interface of various stages, the curriculum and methods of assessment. The overall focus was to redefine the aims of education for Hong Kong in the 21st Century. The EC performed a public consultation exercise, conducted a examination of the existing academic structure, and finally made recommendations to lay a developmental foundation.
