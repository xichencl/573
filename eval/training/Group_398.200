Hong Kong has been responding to the problem of avian influenza through a surveillance system and maintaining public health.  To do this, authorities have needed to monitor each reported case of avian flu and address the problem of transmission from contaminated poultry.

As of late 1998, the influenza programs undertaken by the government had resulted in the absence of any new cases for a year.  Part of the government's action was the Department of Health's influenza surveillance, which had been extended to all public hospitals and outpatient clinics, as well as many general practitioners.  The government also took 18,000 specimens to be tested for avian strains of influenza.  Throat secretion specimens were also taken abroad to the World Health Organization for analysis.

Due to the government's success in flu prevention, it had time to investigate the illness in depth.  Scientists discovered that the primary mode of transmission of avian flu is from poultry to humans, rather than from human to human.

In order to prevent the spread of avian flu, the government reminds the public to build up bodily resistance, observe good hygiene, and use caution near bird feces.  These guidelines are also applicable to preventing influenza of swine origin.
 Control measures on the avian flu were declared effective by experts for the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No new cases of influenza A H5N1 occured in Hong Kong for almost a year. World health scientists and experts on influenza applauded the vigorous and carefully considered action taken by the Hong Kong Government in December 1997, saying that the action might have saved the world from an influenza pandemic.
Part of the action taken was a mass poultry slaughter because the primary mode of transmission of the infection was from poultry to man. Human to human transmission of the virus has not been proven. Blood samples, on-farm testing, and new licensing conditions covering hygiene and management practices work in conjunction with the Agriculture and Fisheries Department which conducts surveillance on birds and markets. These measures have safeguarded the health of poultry and ensured that the disease does not occur.
Two isolated cases of influenza occured in April 1999 but in September, after thorough investigation, the Department of Health and the Special Investigation Group declared that influenza A H9N2 poses no imminent major threat to public health. Both of the infected girls made full recovery.




 Influenza being closely monitored

Following confirmed cases of several different strains of the influenza virus, Government health officials have been on guard.  The Department of Health received confirmation from an overseas labratory that the influenza H3N2 virus isolated from a 10 month-old girl who was treated at Tuen Mun Hospital for fever and influenza like illness last month was of swine origin.  Other strains include influenza A H5N1, which has occurred in Hong Kong for almost a year, and influenza A H9N2, both primarily transmitted from birds or ducks, and therefore called the avian flu.

As part of its influenza surveillance program, the Department of Health closely followed up on the case isolated in the 10-month-old girl with an atypical influenza A H3N2 strain.  However, since overseas patients have made full recoveries in the past, and as this was the first confirmed case of this swine flu in Hong Kong, the Department of Health's Consultant on Community Medicine Dr Mak Kwok-hang did not think there was cause for undue alarm but emphasized the importance of maintaining vigilant influenza surveillance.  While the modes of transmission require more study, it seems for both types the human to human transmission rate remains low.
