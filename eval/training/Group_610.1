The judgments of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) delivered on 29 January 1999 have extended the eligibility for the right of abode (ROA) of persons born in the Mainland of Hong Kong permanent residents beyond that previously provided for in the Immigration Ordinance. In its judgments, the CFA decided that certain provisions in two previous ROA Ordinances were inconsistent with the Basic Law. To reprehend the situation, a motion has been made to appeal to the NPCSC for an interpretation of Basic Law and to find a resolution.
