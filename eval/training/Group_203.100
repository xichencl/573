The Hong Kong government has been working to improve care services for the elderly.

Many citizens were concerned about the time that people have spent on waiting lists to enter government-subsidized care homes.  The government responded that it would implement a system by which only those elderly in genuine need of residential care would be eligible to apply. The Social Welfare Department also planned to give additional resources to  homes, so that the elderly would not need to be transferred between different homes.

In the fall of 1999, the government announced it had shortened the waiting time for care homes and commissioned additional homes. 
 Concerns have surfaced regarding long waiting periods for the applicants of subvented residential care homes for the elderly such as hostels, homes for the aged, care and attention homes, and nursing homes.  The government assures the council that waiting time varies for different applicants based on their health conditions, family status, and specific preferences. In March 2000, waiting time ranged from  5 to 22 months.. For applicants in urgent need, immediate placement can be arranged. The government reports that in April 1999 occupancy rates exceeded 96%. Satisfaction levels regarding service quality are high among family members of the elderly.

 The Elderly Commission met several times this month to discuss a wide range of issues concerning the residential care of the elderly.  Primary among issues of concern is the consideration for more private residential care facilities, increasing the number of available places, and therefore shortening waiting time.  Another commonly suggested solution requires the adoption of new criteria for determining the eligibility of elderly persons for placement residential care homes.

The inquiries of several distinguished individuals prompted a response from the Secretary for Health and Welfare in the Legislative Council.  The Secretary for Health and Welfare cited past effort and continued commitment.
