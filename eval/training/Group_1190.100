The Department of Health has introduced a surveillance system to monitor hand-foot-mouth diesease, a manifestation of Enterovirus 71.  In order to prevent the spread of this virus, the government of Hong Kong urges citizens to practice good hygiene.  

The surveillance system had success in stopping the spread of Enterovirus 71, with the first fatal case of hand-foot-mouth disease occurring eleven months later.  An Interdepartmental Working Group has also been formed to coordinate measures for the prevention and control of Enterovirus 71.  The public are advised to wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet or handling diapers.
 The first fatal case of Enterovirus 71 was reported in Hong Kong since a surveillance system on hand-foot-mouth disease was set up in the territory.  This brings the total number of EV-71 cases in Hong Kong this year to six.

While the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority would closely monitored the situation, a spokesman reminded the public to maintain good personal hygiene.  So long as the public adheres to covering mouth when you cough or sneeze, washing hands after using toilets, changing diapers and before taking meals, the chance of a major outbreak in Hong Kong could be prevented.
  The Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) called upon citizens to maintain personal hygiene to prevent enterovirus infection before the summer of 1999. The appeal was made in response to the death of a child infected with the virus. The disease is usually self-limiting and complete recovery is the rule. However, severe forms of EV-71 infection affecting the brain and the heart can occur. 
 In mid-June 1998 the government set up a sentinel surveillance system to monitor hand-food-mouth disease, which is one of the manifestations of enterovirus disease. In 1998, there were 60 confirmed cases of EV-71, five of whom had neurological complications.
