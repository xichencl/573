Customs officers have been cracking down on the smuggling of dutiable cigarettes into Hong Kong in order to protect public revenue.

Acting on intelligence information and investigations, Customs officials have conducted surveillance operations to find individuals and places involved in the smuggling of cigarettes. In the first five months of 1998, Customs seized more than $50 million worth of smuggled cigarettes with a $28.6 million duty potential. 

Customs reminds the public that anyone found smuggling cigarettes, or dealing, selling, or purchasing dutiable goods, will be subject to a maximum penalty of $1 million and two years in prison.
