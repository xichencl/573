 In Hong Kong, secondary Two to Four students studying in schools in the New Territories and outlying islands, who intend to join the "Know More about Environmental Hygiene Facilities cum Lifeskill Training Camp", were reminded to submit their applications before the deadline for entry. Organised by the Provisional Regional Council in association with the Education Department, the activity aimed to encourage students to make good use of their environmental hygiene facilities and services, and then disseminate the message to their schoolmates, friends and family members. Twenty-four entrants were later appointed Provisional Urban Council Ambassadors at a flag presentation ceremony.
