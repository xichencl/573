For each government election, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) held registration drives that increased registered voters and assured accurate voter registration information. The drive included door-to-door visits by volunteers to assist in registering every eligible voter. A large percentage of new voters are young people aged between 18 and 25. Once the registers have been compiled, it is important for individuals to check their registration particulars and to make corrections or lodge appeals regarding any entry. Both the provisional and final registers of electors are printed and displayed in key locations such as the REO and District Offices for public inspection.
 The first step to voting in Hong Kong is registration to do so. Each year the Registration and electoral Office receives thousands of new application forms for registration and to report changes of residential address.

Later, the names and home addresses of the more than 3 million electors are published for public inspection.   This is done so their registered electors can verify that all of their information has been recorded correctly. Electors may correct information by submitting a notice to the REO.

Only electors whose name appears on the final list are eligible to vote in the Legislative Council election.



  In preparation for a 60-member Legislative Council that made up of 20 seats to be returned from 5 geographical constituencies, 30 seats from 28 functional constituencies and 10 seats from the 800-member Election Committee, which will be formed through subsector elections in early April 1998, the Registration and Electoral Office has received 305,000 application forms for voter registration and report of change of residential address of registered electors since a voter registration drive started on January 17, 2000. An initial assessment finds that more than half of the forms are from first time voters and 40% of those are young people.
