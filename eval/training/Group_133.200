In an effort to bring Hong Kong's legislative control on endangered species in line with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), many species were added to the protection list of the Animals and Plants (Protection of
Endangered Species) Ordinance. This means that possession, import and export of these species, their parts and derivatives are subjected to licensing control with immediate effect. Among those newly added to the control list were some species of squirrels, deer, ducks, dove and turtles which had been identified by individual CITES parties as requiring international co-operation to protect these species from over-exploitation. Also, the government proposed to extend legislative control on the trade and possession of endangered species to include artificially propagated and medicines using endangered species as
ingredients. 
 There have been some arrests made of those violating the amendments such as a twenty one year old man who was found possessing two live Slow Loris without a licence. Also, The defendant pleaded guilty at the San Po Kong Magistracy. Also, a trader trader received a penalty for possession of shahtoosh shawls made from the Tibetan antelopes. She was fined and sentenced to three months imprisonment suspended for 12 months.


 Endangered species are getting a little more help from the Hong Kong government.  There have been several advances in the protection of endangered species. 

First, more species have been added to the protection list.  If a species of plant or animal is on the endangered species protection list the import, export, sale or possession of their parts and derivatives is subject to licensing control.  Included in addition are some species of squirrels, deer, ducks, doves and turtles.

Next, the government proposed to extend legislative control on the trade and possession of endangered species to include artificially propagated plants and medicines using endangered species as ingredients.

The fines for violation of endangered species laws are steep.  A woman was convicted of trading shawls made from the for of Tibetan antelopes.  She was fined $300,000 and sentenced to three months in prison.  Another man was fines $20,000 and sentenced to two months in prison for the illegal possession of two live Slow Loris.

The Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) has also warned the public not to bring items of endangered species back from other countries when they travel, especially during the holiday months.  People usually bring specimen of sea turtles, coral, ivory, parrots and controlled medicines.
 The Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance is legislation created to protect endangered species through governmental control over the import and export of specified plants and animals. The control measure affects commercial groups, traders, and individuals; it is an offence to import, export or possess endangered species without a licence. Persons who intend to import or export listed endangered species must obtain a license from the Agriculture and Fisheries Department. This includes travellers, who should not bring back items of endangered species on their return from visits to other countries during vacation; Customs and Excise officers are following the controls strictly and are enabled to seize any plants or animals that violate the conditions of the ordinance. Restaurants must also have a license for certain meats. The control covers a wide variety of endangered species, including some household pets such as some species of birds, and is not limited to only live animals, but includes their parts and derivatives (such as medicines). The penalties are heavy: breeching the Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance can lead to a maximum penalty of $5 million fine and two years' imprisonment upon conviction when a highly endangered species for commercial purpose is involved.
