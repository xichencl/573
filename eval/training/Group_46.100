 In 1998 the Hong Kong government made a sustained effort to tackle unemployment problems. Comparing April-June 1998 period with March-May 1998, the increase in the unemployment rate occurred mainly in the retail, restaurants and construction sectors. 
 In response, the government initiated a series of measures, such as strengthening the Labour Department's Job Matching Programme, and providing a telephone job matching service and vacancy processing service for job-seekers.
 Attending these measures were decreases in the unemployment rate, seen mainly in the construction, manufacturing, import/export trades, hotels, transport, real estate and insurance sectors. There were also decreases in the underemployment rate.
 

 The unemployment and underemployment rates in Hong Kong during the 1998-99 year have varied.  Both numbers reached lows of 3.9% and 2.2% (unemployment and underemployment, respectfully) during the period of February to April 1998.  The unemployment rate was at a high of 6.3% during the period from February to April 1999.  The underemployment rate reached a high of 3.1% during the periods between July and September of 1999 as well as during the November 1998 to January 1999 period.

The government has taken steps to improve the rates such as undertaking projects that would create new jobs for unemployed adults.


 The Asian financial crisis in 1998 created high unemployment rates in Hong Kong. As unemployment rates rose, the Government had been implementing a wide-ranging series of measures to help the unemployed to rejoin the workforce and equip them with the requisite skills to stay competitive in the labour market. It also created thousands of jobs through major new public works projects. The Labour Department is providing a full range of strengthened services to help unemployed job-seekers find jobs, particularly through its extended Job Matching Programme. Extensive training courses were offered by the Vocational Training Council, which aided the unemployed in retraining and skills upgrading.
