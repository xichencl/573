Officers of the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department are continuing their efforts to crack down on illegal contraband cigarettes with a special Anti-cigarettes Smuggling Task Force. Through the use of intelligence and surveillance, the task force tracks, raids, and seizes shipments and smashes distribution centers of smuggled cigarettes. Millions of dutiable cigarettes have been seized each year as a result of attempts by importers to evade paying millions of dollars in customs fees. Dozens of smugglers and distributors of contraband have also been arrested. Suspects can be charged under two different ordinances, with penalties up to $1-2 million fines and 2-7 years' imprisonment.
