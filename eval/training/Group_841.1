Due to violent crimes in Hong Kong, rewards are given for information on the relevant cases. The rewards are either given to any person, or apportioned amongst persons, giving information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the culprit. Anyone who has information on the cases is urged to report to any police officer.
 For instance, the police were offering a reward of $500,000 for information leading to the detection of a murder and robbery case wherein an Auxiliary Police Officer was attacked and later died in Shek Kip Mei in 1993.
About 9 am on September 1993, the Auxiliary Police Constable was attacked.
