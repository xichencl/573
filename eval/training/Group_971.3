One branch of the Customs and Excise Department is the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau. Along with the Narcotics Bureau, they seek to eradicate dealing in narcotics. One of their biggest targets is heroin trade, smuggling, manufacture, and distribution. By tracking suspicious persons and setting ambushes, many drug manufacturing centres have been uncovers and smashed. Police have also made seizures off private persons, in particular intercepting smugglers at airports and customs control points. There has been an increase in successful seizures, and the amount of heroin seized in Hong Kong has risen by 100 kilograms in the past year, without an increase in drug demand.
