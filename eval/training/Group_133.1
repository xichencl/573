 In an effort to bring Hong Kong's legislative control on endangered species in line with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), many species were added to the protection list of the Animals and Plants (Protection of
Endangered Species) Ordinance. This means that possession, import and export of these species, their parts and derivatives are subjected to licensing control with immediate effect. Among those newly added to the control list were some species of squirrels, deer, ducks, dove and turtles which were identified by CITES parties as requiring international co-operation to protect these species from over-exploitation.
