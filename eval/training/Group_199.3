Spurred by the World Trade Organization, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented measures to fight copyright piracy. Intellectual property rights protection is an essential element in the development of trade, investment and technology transfer, and copyright infringement undermines economic viability. HKSAR's approach to combatting the problem involves legislation, enforcement, education and cooperation with intellectual property rights owners. Two important pieces of legislation have been passed: the Copyright Ordinance and the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance, both of which have helped to strengthen Customs' capabilities in anti-pirating. Hong Kong's laws concerning intellectual property rights are regarded as among the world's highest standard.
