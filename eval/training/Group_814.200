Officers of the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department are continuing their efforts to crack down on the illegal contraband and smuggling of cigarettes with a special Anti-cigarettes Smuggling Task Force. Through the use of intelligence and intense surveillance, the task force tracks, raids, and seizes shipments and smashes distribution centers of smuggled cigarettes in territory-wide operations. Declared manifests are inspected and concealed contraband cigarettes in cargo lorries or ships are intercepted at control points at Hong Kong's borders. Millions of dutiable cigarettes have been seized each year as a result of attempts by importers to evade paying millions of dollars in customs fees; the number of contraband cases has increased tremendously in the past few years. The purpose of these anti-smuggling activites is "to show the determination in protecting public revenue," said a Customs spokesman. Dozens of smugglers and distributors of contraband have also been arrested. Persons committing these offences can be charged under two different ordinances: the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, which carries a maximum penalty of a $1 million fine and two years' imprisonment, and the Import and Export Ordinance, which carries a maximum penalty of a $2 million fine and imprisonment for seven years.
 Customs officers of the General Investigation Division have been busy in their constant efforts in combating smuggling activities. The Anti-Cigarette-Smuggling Task Force is also involved. Customs Marine and Land Enforcement Command raids several black spots of selling smuggled cigarettes.
A spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department said, "There has been an increasing trend of using river trade vessels to smuggle cigarettes into Hong Kong." Customs is monitoring the situation closely and will devise appropriate enforcement strategy to stem this illicit flow.
Customs smashes distribution centers of contraband cigarettes in Hong Kong, and seizes the cigarettes and make arrests.
The Import and Export Ordinance has a penalty for importing unmanifested cargo with a maximum penalty of a $500,000 fine and imprisonment of two years.
The Dutiable Commodities Ordinance has a penalty for the offence of "dealing with goods to which the Diatiable Commodities Ordinance applies," which carries a maximum penalty of a $1 million fine and imprisonment of two years. 
The Department will continue their anti-cigarette smuggling operations to smash distribution centers of contraband cigarettes. It will also continue its vigorous enforcement actions to check the supply of dutiable cigarettes to show the determination in protecting public revenue.


 Customs officers have been cracking down on the smuggling of dutiable cigarettes into Hong Kong.  The Customs Department plans to continue its enforcement activities to protect public revenue.

Acting on intelligence information and investigations, Customs officials have conducted surveillance operations to find individuals and places involved in the smuggling of cigarettes.  Once arrested, the people involved will be charged with "dealing with goods to which Dutiable Commodities Ordinance Applies" or "importing unmanifested cargo" for those who smuggle the cigarettes.

The problem has been growing, but Customs has enforced the law: In October 1999, six cases of river vessels smuggling cigarettes occurred.  During the previous two years, only one case occurred. The government plans to develop new enforcement strategies to stop this illegal flow.  However, in the first five months of 1998, in all locations, Customs seized more than $50 million worth of smuggled cigarettes with a $28.6 million duty potential.

Customs reminds the public that anyone found smuggling cigarettes, or dealing, selling, or purchasing dutiable goods, will be subject to a maximum penalty of $1 million and two years in prison.  The government also plans to share strategies and information with mainland China in its effort to protect public revenue.
