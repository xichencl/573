The first step to voting in Hong Kong is registration to do so.  Later, the names and home addresses of the more than 3 million electors are published for public inspection.  Only electors whose name appears on the final list are eligible to vote in the Legislative Council election.

 For each government election, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) held registration drives that increased registered voters and assured accurate voter registration information. It is important that registration particulars are correct so that eligible voters may vote in their geographical and functional constituencies. Registers of electors are displayed for public inspection.
 In preparation for a 60-member Legislative Council, the REO has received 305,000 application forms for voter registration and report of change of residential address of registered electors since a voter registration drive started on January 17, 2000. An assessment finds more than half of the forms are from first time voters.
