Hong Kong was quick to tackle the problem of non-Y2K-compliant computer systems. The Global 2000 Co-ordinating Group, which monitored compliance work around the world, gave Hong Kong one of the highest ratings for Y2K readiness. The Government spent millions of dollars upgrading and patching software and hardware on dozens of systems, reaching full readiness by October. Contingency plans were also in place to ensure that essential services to the public will not be disrupted, and the public was informed of the possible impact of Y2K. As a result of this extensive preparation, no problematic incidents occured.
 Hong Kong has braced itself and it ready for any curve balls that the turn of the century may throw its way.

Many business and organizations have reported a proposed state of total or near readiness.  

In its December issue of the "Year 2000 Bulletin", the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed that it expected that by the end of 1988, 94% of authorized institutions' critical systems would be Y2K compliant and 88% of their non-critical systems would be.

Of all companies and agencies examined, it seems that Customs Clearance and operations was the only organization not at all affected by the Y2K scare.

 The organization of a Central Co-ordinating Center to ensure quick responses to Year 2000-induced incidents from relevant organisations and Government departments during the rollover to the new millennium was part of a contingency plan by the Hong Kong government.  Speaking at a seminar on Y2K readiness, Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting, Mr K C Kwong said the contingency plan designed to minimize the adverse impact of the Y2K was a top priority.

Efforts of the Information Technology Services Department regarding the readiness for possible Y2K problems were successful as the rollover of the Hong Kong government bureaux and departments went smoothly.
