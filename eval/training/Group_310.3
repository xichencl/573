The Hongkong Post Office issues two to three different sets of commemorative stamps each year, acknowledging special events or wildlife, or community services, such as the 50th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China, the Lunar Year, Hong Kong seashells, and the Hong Kong Red Cross. Each set consists of four designs, each for a different denomination. Presentation packs, mint stamps, and serviced first day covers with a full set of the cancelled stamps were available through advance order. Special postmarks were also introduced for each set, with hand-back service offered at all post offices and all 22 philatelic offices.
