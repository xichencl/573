The theme flower was Cyclamen persicum. The theme of the 2000 show was "A Blooming Millennium".  The theme flower was the Impatient.

 Flower shows exibit a wide variety of cosmopolitan blossoms and exotic plants.

The Chairman of Provisional Regional Council's Recreation and Sports Select Committee, Mr Chan Ping said "the competitive event not only gives a chance for competitors to test their skills but allows flower lovers to share and exchange their horticulture experience."
 The Hong Kong Flower Show is an occasion at which a variety of horticulture can be appreciated.  There are also many competitions that the general public can enter, including flower, plant, and photograph contests.  At the flower show, rare plant species will be on display, and seminars, demonstrations, and games will take place.
