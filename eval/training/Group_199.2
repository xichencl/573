The Hong Kong government remains committed to the protection of intellectual property rights.  Due to the actions of the Customs department, optical disc piracy has been on the decline. 

Customs' ability to enforce against piracy was strengthened under the Copyright Ordinance of June 1997.  In addition, the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance requires all manufacturers of optical discs to be licensed by Customs. In September 1999, the Commissioner of Customs and Excise announced that piracy was under control.  Yet, Hong Kong was still listed on a United States Watch List for intellectual property violations in 1998, reinforcing the need for vigilance.
