The Provisional Regional Council (Pro RC) and Provisional Urban Council (PUC) both presented competitions for students to demonstrate and gain knowledge about public health and environmental hygiene, and then to disseminate their newfound knowledge in their communities. Secondary students have a chance to gain more environmental hygiene knowledge through visits to a number of the Pro RC's hygiene facilities and participation in a lifeskill training camp. The winners of the PUC Ambassador of Hygiene Competition will go to Japan to gain an insight into Japan's hygiene services and facilities, and share with Japanese students on their views in promoting health education in schools.
