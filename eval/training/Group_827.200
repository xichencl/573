Good health and hygiene amongst young people is being promoted through program participation and rewards.

The Provisional Urban Council (PUC) Ambassadors of Hygiene is a title awarded annually to 24 students (ages 11-18) who present exceptional written projects on health.  The competition, is divided into three categories:  Primary, Junior and Senior Secondary.  8 winners are selected from each group.

The winners are named at an award ceremony, picked from a pool of over 350 students.  They enjoy many other awards.  For example the ambassadors go to Japan to discuss public health with Japanese officials.  During the trip, they visit offices such as the Bureau of Public Cleansing, the Tokyo Environmental Centre and the Tokyo Food and Residential Hygiene Center.

Other health-related programs include the "Know More about Environmental Hygiene Facilities cum Life skill Training Camp."  Applications must be submitted, but admission is free.  At this camp children learn about environmental hygiene facilities.

Students take a quiz on what they learned.  The 60 top scorers then are invited to attend a 3-day like skills camp.

At an award ceremony following the completion of one of the 3-day camps, Mr. Leung Kwong-cheong (VP of Pro RC) gave certificates of appreciation to all of the students.

 The Provisional Regional Council (Pro RC) and Provisional Urban Council (PUC) both presented competitions for students to demonstrate and gain knowledge about public health and environmental hygiene. Secondary Two to Four students studying in schools in the New Territories and outlying islands now have a chance to gain more environmental hygiene knowledge through visits to a number of the Pro RC's hygiene facilities and participation in a lifeskill training camp during the summer holiday. The programme encourages students to make good use of the environmental hygiene facilities, and to disseminate the messages to their schoolmates by organising health promotion activities in their schools with the assistance of the Health Education Unit. The training programme in the camp includes imparting knowledge on food and environmental hygiene as well as lifeskill training such as communication skills, leadership and building up of self-confidence. The mission of the PUC Ambassador of Hygiene Competition is to promote food, personal and environmental hygiene in their families and at schools. The winning students will be awarded a free trip to Japan, where they will meet with officials to gain an insight into Japan's hygiene services and facilities, and share with Japanese students on their views in promoting health education in schools.
  In Hong Kong, secondary Two to Four students studying in schools in the New Territories and outlying islands, who intend to join the "Know More about Environmental Hygiene Facilities cum Lifeskill Training Camp", are reminded to submit their applications before the deadline for entry. Organised by the Provisional Regional Council in association with the Education Department, the activity aims to encourage students to make good use of their environmental hygiene facilities and services, and then disseminate the message to their schoolmates, friends and family members.

A spokesman for the Health Education Unit of the Regional Services Department(RSD) said: "I would like to urge students who are interested to participate in the training camp to take their chances and send in their entry forms."

Activities of entrants led to the appointment of twenty-four students as the Provisional Urban Council Ambassadors of Hygiene at a flag presentation. Officiating at the ceremony, Mr. Joseph Chan Yuek-sut said that the written projects were rich in content and attractive in presentation. The Ambassadors will be invited to join the PUC Ambassador of Hygiene Club to participate in a series of health education activities such as hygiene training camp and visits to voluntary organisations.
