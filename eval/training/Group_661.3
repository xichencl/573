Over the past few years, the Hong Kong Education Commission (EC) has taken several steps at reforming the system of education in the country. 

The EC held meetings at which they discussed performing a review of the country's academic structure.  They vowed to take a look at the goals of education and the aims of different education stages.  

In Hong Kong, education accounts for 21% of government spending.  For the 2000-2001 Budget, the government set aside $800 million.  According to EC Chairman Mr. Anthony Leung, this was to enable some of the more urgent reform recommendations of the EC to be put into place.
