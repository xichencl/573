Endangered species are getting a little more help from the Hong Kong government. 

More species have been added to the protection list.  If a species of plant or animal is on the endangered species protection list the import, export, sale or possession of their parts and derivatives is subject to licensing control. 

The government also proposed to extend legislative control on the trade and possession of endangered species.

The Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) has also warned the public not to bring items of endangered species back from other countries when they travel abroad, especially during the holiday months.
