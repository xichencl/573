Hong Kong has taken note of the growth of the internet and e-commerce.  Deciding that involvement in e-commerce is essential to keeping afloat in the world economy, the country has has taken steps to integrate electronic transactions into the operation of its government and businesses.

In a luncheon speech, the Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting, outlined steps towards using e-commerce.

The Government will set up a Certification Authority (CA) Recognition Office which will enable users to do business over the internet and via other electronic means.  This program is just one part of the "Digital 21" Information Technology Strategy. 

 The development of electronic commerce is necessary for Hong Kong's success in the future.  To help this new technology develop, the government is taking the lead in ensuring that the public accepts electronic commerce as a valid way to make transactions.

The Hongkong Post plans to establish a public key infrastructure, so that businesses can identify the parties in an electronic transaction.  The government also plans to give digital signatures used for electronic transactions the same legal status as signatures on paper. 

In 1999, the number of internet users in Hong Kong, as well as the number of users making online purchases, increased sharply.
 To maintain its competitive economic edge, the Hong Kong Government has pledged to promote the development of e-commerce, a growing source for billions of dollars in revenue. The greatest step is in the newly legislated Electronic Transactions Bill, which is intended to give electronic records and digital signatures the same legal status as their paper-based counterparts. It will provide the necessary legal framework and a secure and trusted environment for the conduct of electronic transactions. When enacted, the bill will substantiate the necessary operations of the Certification Authorities (CAs), which authenticates the identity of participants in electronic commerce.
