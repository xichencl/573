Concerns have surfaced regarding long waiting periods for the applicants of subvented residential care homes for the elderly such as hostels, homes for the aged, care and attention homes, and nursing homes.  The government assures the council that waiting time varies for different applicants based on their health conditions, family status, and specific preferences.

 The Elderly Commission met several times this month to discuss a wide range of issues concerning the residential care of the elderly.  Primary among concerns is the consideration of subsidising more private residential care facilities, increasing the number of available places, and therefore shortening waiting time.
 The Hong Kong government has been working to improve care services for the elderly.

In order to shorten the waiting time for government-subsidized care homes, the government decided to restrict applications to only those elderly in genuine need of residential care.

The government managed to shorten the waiting times, while commissioning additional homes.
