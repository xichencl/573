The Hong Kong Customs and Excise department has received much praise for doing good work.

One of Customs' main concerns is the protection of intellectual property rights and the maintenance of Hong Kong as a pirate-free zone.  This is important as Hong Kong seeks to increase its investment in technology. 

Also of concern is the protection of the integrity of the department.  Customs' constantly reviews its work procedures to minimize chances of corruption.

Hong Kong Customs does not work completely independently;  The department has signed a Customs Cooperative arrangement aimed at strengthening its relationship with the Customs General Administration of  China.



 The Customs and Excise Department contributes significantly to law and order in society and the economic well-being of Hong Kong. It is committed to the enforcement of 48 different pieces of legislation, such as the protection of revenue on dutiable commodities, the detection of drug trafficking and smuggling, and the protection of intellectual property rights. The Department has been repeatedly praised for its excellance in discharging these duties, and its professionalism and dedication. It has sustained efforts to maintain Hong Kong as a separate customs territory after its return to China, thus ensuring the success of the "one country, two systems" policy.
  The Chief Executive, Mr Tung Chee Hwa,in September '99 noted that the Hong Kong Customs Department had taken vigorous actions against rights infringement activities and had established close links with mainland international law enforcement authorities as well as the relevant authorities to protect intellectual property rights.
 He noted that the Department had proven to the world through its unrelenting boundary control and active participation in the international customs arena that Hong Kong remained a separate customs territory after its return to China, and that the concept of "one country, two systems" had been implemented successfully in Hong Kong.
