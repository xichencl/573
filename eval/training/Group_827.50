Good health and hygiene is being promoted through program participation and rewards.

The PUC Ambassadors of Hygiene is a prestegious award given to 24 students who present exceptional written projects on health.  Other programs include the "Know More about Environmental Hygiene Facilities cum Life skill Training Camp."  
 In Hong Kong, health education for children partly consists of the "Know More about Environmental Hygiene Facilities cum Lifeskill Training Camp." Organized by the PRC, the activity aimed to encourage students to make good use of their environmental hygiene facilities and services, and to disseminate the message to their schoolmates.


 
 The Provisional Regional Council (Pro RC) and Provisional Urban Council (PUC) both presented competitions for students to demonstrate and gain knowledge about public health and environmental hygiene, and then to disseminate their newfound knowledge in their communitites. The Pro RC offers a lifeskill camp, while the PUC offers a study trip to Japan.
