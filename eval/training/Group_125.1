A research sub-committee of the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) commissioned research on treatment and rehabilitation to assist the government and the ACAN in the formulation of anti-drug policies and programs. The government has five strategies to combat drug trafficking and abuse; law enforcement, preventative education and publicity, treatment and rehabilitation, research, and international cooperation. The Beat Drugs Fund supports anti-drug projects. As drug abuse decreases, organized crime is still a challenge in combating drug-trafficking. For this reason, the ACAN visited Singapore to strengthen international cooperation in the anti-drug area. Locally, the government is introducing schemes requiring registration of drug treatment centers.
