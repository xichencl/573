There were a string of customs operations against the sale of illicit cigarettes.

One seizure was conducted my customs officers form the Marine and Land Enforcement (MLE) Division.  The officers seized $150K worth of dutiable cigarettes. The MLE Division also ran an operation codenamed "Operation Torpedo".  The ten-hour operation saw many of Hong Kongs black spots raided and resulted in the arrest of 11 men and 5 women.  Those arrested will be charged with offences in relation with dealing with goods to which dutiable commodities apply and sale of dutiable goods. 

The Customs Anti-Illicit Cigarette Task Force(CTF) has been established to step up enformemenct actions against illegal cigarette purchase and distribution.

The CTF and the MLE conducted a joint operation.  The 12-hour sting resulted in the seizure of illicit cigarettes which carried a market value of $80,000 and a duty potential of $45,000.  11 people were arrested including two buyers.

Customs officers also broke up a dutiable cigarettes packaging and storage centre in Sham Shui Po. About $1 million in cigarettes were recovered.  This bundel had an extimated duty potential of $500,000.

People arrested in all of the seizures have been between the ages of 17 and 82 years old.
 The Hong Kong Customs Department is continuing its vigilance in cracking down on the smuggling of dutiable cigarettes with its Anti-Cigarette-Smuggling Task Force. Officers of this Task Force have been making seizures of illegal goods and arrests of those persons smuggling them. Trough intensive information analysis and investigation, they have also tracked down and smashed contraband cigarette distribution centers. The Task Force joined with the Marine and Land Enforcement Command to conduct operations in illicit cigarette activities at the retail street level. Millions of cigarette sticks which could have brought in millions of dollars in customs duties have been seized. A spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department appealed to the public not to buy illicit cigarettes as both the buyer and seller will face a criminal charge under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance. Arrested persons will be charged under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance. The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment of two years, and the Department will pursue stringent enforcement. The Department will continue its vigorous enforcement actions to check the supply of dutiable cigarettes to show the determination in protecting public revenue. Members of the public are encouraged to provide information through the Customs hotline.
 On February 10, 2000, customs officers from the Marine and Land Enforcement (MLE) Division seized about 100,000 sticks of dutiable cigarettes, which carried a market value of about $150,000 and a duty potential of about $80,000, in an operation against the sale of dutiable cigarettes at street level in Mong Kok.

About 15 minutes later, Customs officers saw a man moving six cartons at 377 New Reclamation Street. The officers immediately intercepted the man and seized about 60,000 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes at the staircases between the second and third floor.
