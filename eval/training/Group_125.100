A research sub-committee of the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) commissioned research on treatment and rehabilitation to assist the government and the ACAN in the formulation of anti-drug policies and programs. The government has five strategies to combat drug trafficking and abuse; law enforcement, preventative education and publicity, treatment and rehabilitation, research, and international cooperation. The Beat Drugs Fund supports anti-drug projects. As drug abuse decreases, organized crime is still a challenge in combating drug-trafficking. For this reason, the ACAN visited Singapore to strengthen international cooperation in the anti-drug area. Locally, the government is introducing schemes requiring registration of drug treatment centers.


 Law enforcement has sound legislation backing its efforts to control the supply, manufacture, and storage of dangerous drugs. And serious efforts by police and customs officials are being taken to target traffickers.

Despite a continuing fall in the number of reported drug abuse cases and young drug abusers in Hong Kong, the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) Research Sub-committee will commission research on treatment and rehabilitation for drug abusers. In addition, several initiative are being implemented to educate the public on the consequences of abusing drugs, increase community support and involvement programs, and help addicts in several stages of rehabilitation.



 Despite a general decline in drug abuse over the past few years, the government remains committed to addressing the persistent problems posed by drugs. 

The Action Committee Against Narcotics has commissioned studies on the treatment of drug abusers.  The studies seek to illuminate the cause of chronic drug abuse and relapse after treatment, as well as the best motivational strategy for use during treatment.

To educate the public on the hazards of drugs, the ACAN has proposed a drug information center, along with other publicity measures.

The government also plans to require anyone running a drug treatment or rehabilitation program to apply for registration.
