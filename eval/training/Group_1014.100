In an effort to curb traffic offenses, the Eastern District Police regularly conduct Eastern Traffic Days. During a period from 8 am to 4 pm on a weekday, usually a Wednesday, Thursday, or a Friday, police officers from Eastern District Headquarters, North Point Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Chai Wan Division and Eastern District Traffic Team are deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district. They issue fixed penalty tickets for illegal parking and other traffic offenses, and dispense summonses for jay-walkers. They also cautioned many other pedestrians and drivers for minor traffic offenses.
  Eastern District Police officers issued 126 fixed penalty tickets and 33 summonses against road users violating traffic regulations during an operation conducted between 8 am and 4 pm on May 26, 1999. Twenty-six officers from Eastern District Headquarters, North Point Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Chai Wan Division and Eastern District Traffic Team were deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district. 114 tickets were issued for illegal parking. Thirty-one jaywalkers were summonsed. Thirty-eight pedestrians and 77 drivers were cautioned for committing minor traffic offences during the eight-hour operation. 
 This is one among many such operations.
 If police officers got paid by the ticket, then I'm sure that Eastern Traffic Day is their favorite day of the year.  On this day between 8 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon, police are out in large numbers strictly enforcing traffic laws that often go ignored.  Most often, the police patrol areas that are well-known for major traffic problems.  

Officers from Eastern District Headquarters, North Point Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Chai Wan Division and Eastern District Traffic Team were deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district.  Usually 20-30 officers are deployed to carry-out the operation.
