 The Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) called upon citizens to maintain personal hygiene to prevent enterovirus infection before the summer of 1999. The appeal was made in response to the death of a child infected with the virus. The disease is usually self-limiting and complete recovery is the rule. However, severe forms of EV-71 infection affecting the brain and the heart can occur. 
 In mid-June 1998 the government set up a sentinel surveillance system to monitor hand-food-mouth disease, which is one of the manifestations of enterovirus disease. In 1998, there were 60 confirmed cases of EV-71, five of whom had neurological complications.
