 British abdication of control of Hong Kong to China presents a rather peculiar situation. Essentially there now exists one country but two legal and cultural systems. In efforts to smooth the transition and talk about rendition there have been numerous dialogues between the two. 
 For instance, the Secretary for Security, Mrs. Regina Ip, has held useful and positive discussions with the Mainland authorities on rendition during her stay in Beijing. The purpose of the visit was to hold exploratory discussions with the Mainland authorities on rendition and to pay courtesy calls on the relevant ministries and state agencies.
 Official representatives of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have made several important visits with senior officials in Beijing to discuss subjects of mutual concern between the central government of the People's Republic of China and the SAR. These meetings helped to enhance the communication and understanding between the two governments and accomodate a smooth relationship after the Handover. Both sides acknowledged that given the immense differences in the legal and judicial systems in the Mainland and the HKSAR, the subject is very complicated. Under the "one country, two systems" principle, it was agreed that Hong Kong would continue to have autonomy.
 Officials in Hong Kong, through visits and meetings, are attempting to make stronger ties with the Mainland.

The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mrs. Anson Chan, visited Beijing to begin talks with important officials. Other visits to Beijing include a trip to be taken by the secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Mr. Michael Suen.  The Financial Secretary, Mr. Donald Tsang, will visit Beijing to make courtesy calls to the Vice-Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs and meet with bank officials to discuss financial matters. A ten-member delegation of the immigration Department will also visit the Mainland to help promote a better working relationship with Mainland Authorities.
