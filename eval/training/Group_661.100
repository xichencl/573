 EC was asked by the Chief Executive in his first Policy Address to undertake a thorough review of the education system in Hong Kong to see how it should develop in the 21st century. 
 The Chairman of the Education Commission (EC), the Hon Antony Leung, announced the outcome of the consultation.   "...the community want educational reform. The present system is considered too examination-oriented, with too much emphasis on rote-learning. It can no longer meet the needs of Hong Kong. The public also generally agree with the aims of education as stated, although some want the aims to be more specific and measurable."
 In light of a clear need for educational reform, the Chief Executive has asked the Education Commission (EC) to begin a thorough review of the structure of pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary education, addressing the age at which students should begin each stage of education, the duration and interface of various stages, the curriculum and methods of assessment. The overall focus was to redefine the aims of education for Hong Kong in the 21st Century. The EC performed a public consultation exercise, conducted a examination of the existing academic structure, and finally made recommendations to lay a developmental foundation.
 Over the past few years, the Hong Kong Education Commission (EC) has taken several steps at reforming the system of education in the country. 

The EC held meetings at which they discussed performing a review of the country's academic structure.  They vowed to take a look at the goals of education and the aims of different education stages.  

In Hong Kong, education accounts for 21% of government spending.  For the 2000-2001 Budget, the government set aside $800 million.  According to EC Chairman Mr. Anthony Leung, this was to enable some of the more urgent reform recommendations of the EC to be put into place.
