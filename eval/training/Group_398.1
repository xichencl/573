Control measures on the avian flu were declared effective by experts for the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No new cases of influenza A H5N1 occured in Hong Kong for almost a year. World health scientists and experts on influenza applauded the action taken by the Hong Kong Government in December 1997, saying that it might have saved the world from an influenza pandemic.
One action taken was a mass poultry slaughter because the primary mode of transmission of the infection was from poultry to man. Human to human transmission of the virus has not been proven.
