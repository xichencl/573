 In an effort to bring Hong Kong's legislative control on endangered species in line with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), many species were added to the protection list of the Animals and Plants (Protection of
Endangered Species) Ordinance. This means that possession, import and export of these species, their parts and derivatives are subjected to licensing control with immediate effect. Among those newly added to the control list were some species of squirrels, deer, ducks, dove and turtles which were identified by CITES parties as requiring international co-operation to protect these species from over-exploitation.
 Endangered species are getting a little more help from the Hong Kong government. 

More species have been added to the protection list.  If a species of plant or animal is on the endangered species protection list the import, export, sale or possession of their parts and derivatives is subject to licensing control. 

The government also proposed to extend legislative control on the trade and possession of endangered species.

The Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) has also warned the public not to bring items of endangered species back from other countries when they travel abroad, especially during the holiday months.

 The Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance is legislation created to protect endangered species through governmental control over the import and export of specified plants and animals. The control measure affects commercial groups, traders, and individuals; it is an offence to import, export or possess endangered species without a licence. Persons who intend to import or export listed endangered species must obtain a license from the Agriculture and Fisheries Department. The control measure also covers animal and plant parts, meats, and derivatives (such as medicine). Breeching the Ordinance can lead to a maximum penalty of $5 million fine and two years' imprisonment.
