The Hong Kong Customs Department is continuing its vigilance in cracking down on the smuggling of dutiable cigarettes with its Anti-Cigarette-Smuggling Task Force. Officers of this Task Force have been making seizures of illegal goods and arrests of those persons smuggling them, and also smashing contraband distribution centers.
 There were a string of customs stings and seizures regarding the sale of illicit cigarettes.

The two main organizations that are fighting against the trafficing of illicit cigarettes are the Marine and Land Enforcement Division and the Customs Anti-Illicit Cigarette Task Force.

People arrested were between 17 and 82 years old.
 In 1999-2000, customs officers conducted a number, over 115, of successful raids in Mong Kok and other areas. 61 people, including 16 buyers, were arrested. Over 3.1 million sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized. In the attempt to stem sale of illicit cigarettes, a Customs Anti-Illicit Cigarette Task Force was established in April 2000.
