Customs officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau are busy fighting piracy and other crimes involving intellectual property rights. 
Customs officers work at all control points, including airports and sea ports, to catch smugglers trying to import pirated discs.
Customs conducts intensive investigations which lead to smashing factories engaged in producing pirated optical discs, smashing disc storage centers, seizing discs and paraphernalia from shops, and arresting responsible parties. Smashing shops often leads to the cessation of their business. Customs also typically conducts follow-up raids.

Customs will continue their enforcement actions in combating piracy activities and preserving the good image of Hong Kong.
