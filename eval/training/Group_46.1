 In 1998 the Hong Kong government made a sustained effort to tackle unemployment problems. Comparing April-June 1998 period with March-May 1998, the increase in the unemployment rate occurred mainly in the retail, restaurants and construction sectors. 
 In response, the government initiated a series of measures, such as strengthening the Labour Department's Job Matching Programme, and providing a telephone job matching service and vacancy processing service for job-seekers.
 Attending these measures were decreases in the unemployment rate, seen mainly in the construction, manufacturing, import/export trades, hotels, transport, real estate and insurance sectors. There were also decreases in the underemployment rate.
