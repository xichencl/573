 The Executive Council of Hong Kong endorsed the Immigration Bill 1997 to the Provisional Legislative Council. The Bill provides that children who claim the right to abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must produce proof of their right by way of a Certificate of Entitlement. The COE is in response to the reunification of Hong Kong and China. Due to a law already in place many mainland children have a right they did not formerly possess. If all these children arrived in Hong Kong at once, the impact on the social support services would be difficult to bear.
