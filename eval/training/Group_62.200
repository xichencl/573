Hong Kong was quick to tackle the problem of non-Y2K-compliant computer systems. The Global 2000 Co-ordinating Group, which monitored compliance work around the world, gave Hong Kong one of the highest ratings for Y2K readiness. The Government spent millions of dollars upgrading and patching software and hardware on dozens of systems; readiness was at 96% in May and was reached by late October 1999. Contingency plans were also in place to ensure that essential services to the public will not be disrupted. The Government also launched publicity to insure that the public understood the possible impact of the Y2K problem. Checklists were published to assist the public in fixing non-compliant systems. Early action for all parties was strongly urged and generally heeded. 9 September 1999 has been generally considered to be one of the critical dates for the smooth transition of computer systems to year 2000. For the rollover, the Government had set up a Central Co-ordinating Centre (CCC) to monitor the territory-wide situation and to co-ordinate cross-sector emergency responses to Y2K-induced incidents. No reports on Y2K-induced incidents were reported. Hundreds of staff members were on hand during the actual turnover period. As a result of this extensive preparation, no problematic incidents occured.
 The Honk Kong government's effort to reduce risk of Y2K rollover to computer systems successful.  

The organization of a Central Co-ordinating Center to ensure quick responses to Year 2000-induced incidents from relevant organisations and Government departments during the rollover to the new millennium was part of a contingency plan by the Hong Kong government.  Speaking at a seminar on Y2K readiness, Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting, Mr K C Kwong said the contingency plan designed to minimize the adverse impact of the Y2K was a top priority.  He said, "The Central Co-ordinating Center will work closely with the co-ordinating centers established in 13 essential service sectors, including food supply, transport, financial services, public order, fire and emergency services, environment, aviation, public health, telecommunication, port management, energy supply, immigration and broadcasting." 

Efforts of the Information Technology Services Department regarding the readiness of Hong Kong for possible Y2K problems were successful as the rollover of the Hong Kong government bureaux and departments went smoothly.  A spokesman said the some 900 staff members of the Department were "glad that they have been actively involved and have participated in bringing the transition of the Government to the new millennium a success."
 Hong Kong has braced itself and it ready for any curve balls that the turn of the century may throw its way.

Many business and organizations have reported either a proposed state of total readiness or something close thereto.  

In its December issue of the "Year 2000 Bulletin", the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) revealed that it expected that by the end of 1988, 94% of authorized institutions' critical systems would be Y2K compliant and 88% of their non-critical systems would be.

To prepare the general public for Y2K, the Information Technology and Broadcasting Bureau published 3 checklists indicating the likely impact of Y2K on common systems found within the home.  The Government even set up a web site: http://www.year2000.gov.kh to address public questions and concerns.

Of all companies and agencies examined, it seems that Customs Clearance and operations was the only organization not at all affected by the Y2K scare.

Even as Y2K came and went, life in Hong Kong seemed to move on interrupted more by the fear of Y2K than by the actual event.  The Information Technology Services Department (ITSD) and government bureaus and departments all had smooth roll-overs with no disruption to their mission-critical computers.
