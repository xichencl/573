  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) along with the Urban Services Department, in efforts to stem cholera and safeguard public health, have mounted blitz operations against unlicensed food factories selling snacks and cooked food in Mong Kok district. There has been proliferation of these small scale food factories that sell snacks and cooked food, specifically, shellfish, non-bottled drinks and Siu Mei and Lo Mei, in sub-divided shop units. Most of these premises are not qualified for a food licence and their hygiene standards are poor, often storing food in open spaces and preparing food on the pavement in front of these shops. 
 The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and Urban Services Department have been active in shutting down unlicensed food vendors.  These vendors are likely to be a threat to public health due to unsanitary conditions of food preparation.

In order to speed up prosecution of the proprietors of these food vendors, arrest actions were taken in addition to normal prosecution.

In the Food Business Regulation, it is stated that those in the food business cannot leave food open to contamination or wrap the food in unclean material.  In the face of diseases such as cholera, the prosecution of unlicensed food vendors is important.
 Widespread existence of unlicensed food vendors has caused the Urban Services Department (USD) to step up law enforcement action against them.  Steps taken include increasing the frequency of inspections to restaurants and stepping up prosecution actions against irregularities found on these premises.
 
Also involved in attempting to eliminate the existence of these unlicensed food factories is the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD).  The FEHD launched several sting operations in and around Mong Kok.  One of these stings resulted inthe arrest of six operators.  Also recovered from the operation was 93 kilograms of cooked food which was possibly exposed to contamination.
