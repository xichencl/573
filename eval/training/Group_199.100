Customs Commissioner, Mr.John Tsang Chun-wah assured that Customs is fully committed to intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and will continue to maintain Hong Kong as a pirate-free zone. 

Hong Kong had remained on the "Watch List" of the United States Trade Representative's _Special 301 Report_ on the protection of IPR for 1997 and 1998.

Approximately 150 delegates attented the World Intellectual Property Organization Asian Regional Symposium.  In his keynote speech, Mr. Chau Tak Hay said the three new laws which were enacted last year meet the high standards of the Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement of the World Trade Organization.



 The Hong Kong government remains committed to the protection of intellectual property rights.  Due to the actions of the Customs department, optical disc piracy has been on the decline. 

Customs' ability to enforce against piracy was strengthened under the Copyright Ordinance of June 1997.  In addition, the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance requires all manufacturers of optical discs to be licensed by Customs. In September 1999, the Commissioner of Customs and Excise announced that piracy was under control.  Yet, Hong Kong was still listed on a United States Watch List for intellectual property violations in 1998, reinforcing the need for vigilance.
 Spurred by the World Trade Organization, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented measures to fight copyright piracy. Intellectual property rights protection is an essential element in the development of trade, investment and technology transfer, and copyright infringement undermines economic viability. HKSAR's approach to combatting the problem involves legislation, enforcement, education and cooperation with intellectual property rights owners. Two important pieces of legislation have been passed: the Copyright Ordinance and the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance, both of which have helped to strengthen Customs' capabilities in anti-pirating. Hong Kong's laws concerning intellectual property rights are regarded as among the world's highest standard.
