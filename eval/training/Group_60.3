 The Chief Executive, Mr Tung Chee Hwa,in September '99 noted that the Hong Kong Customs Department had taken vigorous actions against rights infringement activities and had established close links with mainland international law enforcement authorities as well as the relevant authorities to protect intellectual property rights.
 He noted that the Department had proven to the world through its unrelenting boundary control and active participation in the international customs arena that Hong Kong remained a separate customs territory after its return to China, and that the concept of "one country, two systems" had been implemented successfully in Hong Kong.
