Hong Kong Chief Executive, Mr Tung Chee Hwa, has travelled extensively to meet with other world leaders to strengthen and update political and economic ties. His main purpose in many of these visits has been to assure that business and trade affairs are running as smoothly as ever after the Reunification with the People's Republic of China in 1997. He has briefed senior officials on the smooth implementation of the "one country, two systems" principle and latest developments in Hong Kong and has reassured that despite an Asian financial crisis, Hong Kong financial markets have remained stable due to its sound economic fundamentals. Mr Tung has also emphasized Hong Kong's advantages as a business and service centre, and the importance the SAR attaches to the development of information technology and high value-added industries. In talks with the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), he has stressed continued co-operation in trade liberalisation and the use and development of information technology, due partially to China's recent accession to the World Trade Organization. Also important have been meetings with the European Union, in which he has stated that Hong Kong is fully committed to free and open trade, the rule of law and the enforcement of international treaties.
