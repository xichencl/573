Hong Kong Chief Executive, Mr Tung Chee Hwa, has travelled extensively to strengthen and update political and economic ties. His main purpose in many visits has been to assure that business and trade affairs are running as smoothly as ever after the Reunification with the People's Republic of China in 1997. He has briefed senior officials on the smooth implementation of the "one country, two systems" principle and latest developments in Hong Kong. Mr Tung has also emphasized Hong Kong's advantages as a business and service centre, and the importance the SAR attaches to the development of information technology and high value-added industries.
