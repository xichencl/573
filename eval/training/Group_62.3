The organization of a Central Co-ordinating Center to ensure quick responses to Year 2000-induced incidents from relevant organisations and Government departments during the rollover to the new millennium was part of a contingency plan by the Hong Kong government.  Speaking at a seminar on Y2K readiness, Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting, Mr K C Kwong said the contingency plan designed to minimize the adverse impact of the Y2K was a top priority.

Efforts of the Information Technology Services Department regarding the readiness for possible Y2K problems were successful as the rollover of the Hong Kong government bureaux and departments went smoothly.
