The Housing Authority (HA) has taken several steps to make renting and buying homes easier.

The Chief Executive in Council approved amended resale restrictions for flats sold under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) and Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS) to bring them in line with those approved for Tenants Purchase Scheme (TPS) flats.  To provide greater flexibility to HOS flat owners, the ten-year resale restriction period was shortened to five years. The accessibility of single persons to home ownership was also enhanced.

The HA also took measures to ensure early recovery of public rental housing flats under various home ownership schemes.


 The Housing Authority's Home Ownership Committee (HOC) has relaxed many restrictions on flat purchase and rental. One is that the resale restriction period for Home Ownership Scheme (HOS)/Private Sector Participation Scheme flats is shortened to enhance the attractiveness of HOS and promote mobility of flats, both in the open market and the secondary HOS market, and will also allow more rental flats to be recovered for allocation to needy families. The HOC is also opening up HOS flat availability to single persons, for small flats; this was later relaxed to allow singles to purchase larger flats in buildings where all families have already chosen.
  Resale restriction period for Home Ownership Scheme (HOS)/Private Sector Participation Scheme flats was shortened to enhance the attractiveness of HOS and help promote mobility of flats in the open market and the secondary HOS market. It is intended that through activities in the secondary HOS market, more rental flats can be recovered for allocation to needy families. Approval to relax the resale restrictions was made in February 1999, by the Housing Authority's Home Ownership Committee (HOC). The relaxation is also intended to coincide with arrangements under the Tenants Purchase Scheme by bringing in a uniformed, consistent approach in resale restrictions for the schemes.
