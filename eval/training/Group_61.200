Charitable non-profits can raise funds on Government-approved Flag Days. On a flag day, non-profit organizations either sell flags, tokens or similar items, or place donation boxes in designated public places.  In order to hold a flag day, bona-fide non-profits must apply to the government a year in advance. The organization must prove in its application its integrity and management capabilites; the nature, value, and standard of its existing services; and its financial needs and ability to organize a flag day. Most flag days are held on Saturdays; non-Saturday flag days are advertised as such. For example, in 1998, the Social Welfare Department allocated an additional non-Saturday flag day to six charitable organizations to raise funds for the relief of the Yangtze River flood victims in the mainland. To qualify as a genuine, government-recognized non-profit agency, it must fall within one of the following categories as established by English case law: relief of poverty; advancement of education; advancement of religion; or other charitable purposes not specified in the preceding categories. Also, a non-profit must be established in Hong Kong to receive tax exemption. If a charity fails to meet these standards, then its tax exemption status can be withdrawn.
  Non-Saturday flag day on September 30, 1998. With the endorsement of the Subvention and Lotteries Fund Advisory Committee, the Social Welfare Department allocated an additional flag day on September 30 (Wednesday) to six charitable organisations to raise funds for the relief of the Yangtze River flood victims in the mainland. The six charitable organisations are Tung Wah Group of Hospitals; Po Leung Kuk; The Lok Sin Tong Benevolent Society, Kowloon; Pok Oi Hospital; Yan Chai Hospital; and Yan Oi Tong. A spokesman of the department said that it was one of the 11 non-Saturday flag days during the year. Including the non-Saturday flag days, there are altogether 62 flag days this year.
 Flag days are days in which non-profit organisations seek support. Any organisation that has activities involving collection of money or sale or exchange for donation of badges, tokens or similar articles in a public place for charitable purposes must have applied for a public subscription permit from the Social Welfare Department.
 A spokesman appealed to organisers to take precautions against any possible fraud. "Sellers should display the permit or in case of mobile fund-raising, carry copies of the permit for inspection upon request," he said.





 Nine not for profit organizations (The Hong Kong sports Association for the Mentally Handicapped, The Maryknoll Medical & Welfare Association, AIDS Concern Foundation, Ltd.,Hong Kong Lutheran Church for the Deaf, Ltd., Light and Love Home, Lok Hong Social Service Association, Pok Oi Hospital, The Hong Kong Church of Christ Co. Ltd, The Association of Chinese Evangelical Ministry, Ltd.) were given the right to raise funds (also known as holding a flag day).  This is a day when the organization can sell flags or tokens to raise money. Also, they can place donation boxes in designated public locations.

In order to hold a flag day, the organization must apply to the Social Welfare Department (SWD) by a given deadline and the organization must be a non-profit organization.  Each application is considered by the Subventions and Lotteries Fund Advisory Committee.  Applications are available at the SWD Headquarters at Room 920, Wu Chung House, 213 Queen's Road East, Wan Chai.

Most non-profit organizations are charitable organizations usually involved in poverty relief, advancement of education or other public services.

Most flag days are held on Saturday, although some are held on Wednesdays.  Information about flag days can be obtained from the Department's Hotline or the SWD Headquarters.
