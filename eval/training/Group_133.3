The Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance is legislation created to protect endangered species through governmental control over the import and export of specified plants and animals. The control measure affects commercial groups, traders, and individuals; it is an offence to import, export or possess endangered species without a licence. Persons who intend to import or export listed endangered species must obtain a license from the Agriculture and Fisheries Department. The control measure also covers animal and plant parts, meats, and derivatives (such as medicine). Breeching the Ordinance can lead to a maximum penalty of $5 million fine and two years' imprisonment.
