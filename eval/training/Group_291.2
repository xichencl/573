The first step to voting in Hong Kong is registration to do so. Each year the Registration and electoral Office receives thousands of new application forms for registration and to report changes of residential address.

Later, the names and home addresses of the more than 3 million electors are published for public inspection.   This is done so their registered electors can verify that all of their information has been recorded correctly. Electors may correct information by submitting a notice to the REO.

Only electors whose name appears on the final list are eligible to vote in the Legislative Council election.
