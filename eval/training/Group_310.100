 For example, stamps on "Hong Kong Scouts" were issued in July 1998. They were designed by Gideon Lai. This set of stamps depicts different sections of Hong Kong. They are Grasshopper Scouts and Cub Scouts; Venture Scouts; and Rover Scouts and adult leaders. As of July 1998, the stamps were on display for the advance information of the public at the General Post Office, Tsim Sha Tsui Post Office, Tsuen Wan Post Office and Sha Tin Central Post Office.
 The Hongkong Post Office issues two to three different sets of commemorative stamps each year, acknowledging special events or wildlife, or community services, such as the 50th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China, the Lunar Year, Hong Kong seashells, and the Hong Kong Red Cross.
