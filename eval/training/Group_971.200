 The Chineese government, specifically the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau and the Narcotics Bureau, have been engaged in various efforts to stem the heroin trade. There were a number of arrests of individuals, neutralisation of various centrse for drug manufacturing, and prevention of influx of drugs into the country. 

 For example, a 44-year-old man arrested by Customs Drug Investigation Bureau appeared in Kwun Tong Magistracy on April 28, 2000 charged with trafficking in a dangerous drug and manufacturing a dangerous drug. The suspect was arrested by the officers yesterday in Lam Tin following the seizure of 820 grams of No. 4 heroin worth about $500,000.

 The Narcotics Bureau Police believed that a drug manufacturing centre was neutralised following the arrest of a 39-year-old man and the seizure of $16 million of suspected No.4 heroin by officers attached to the Narcotics Bureau December 16, 1999.

 And,  Acting on intelligence, Customs officers of the Airport Investigation Division and Customs Drug Investigation Bureau January 5, 1999, conducted an anti-narcotics operation to process outgoing passengers at the departure level of the Airport. As a result, two people were found body-packed with 2.9 kilograms and 3.2 kilograms of high grade heroin.







 Customs Agents have made several heroin seizures and arrested several people charged with illegal drug trafficking.  Most of the reports involved high-grade heroin.

Acting on intelligence, Customs officers of the Airport Investigation Division and Customs Drug Investigation Bureau conducted an anti-narcotics operation to process outgoing passengers at the departure level of the Airport.  At the end of the day, two men (ages 22 and 37) who were on their way to Taiwan were arrested and 6.1 kilograms of heroin was seized.  (One man had 2.9 kilograms; the other had 3.2 kilograms).  Another airport seizure included 7.5 kilograms of heroin (worth $7.5 million) taken from two women, ages 28 and 34.

There were other busts in places such as Fanling, Wong Tai Sin, Kwun Tong, Lo Wu Control Point, Sha Tin, Tuen Mun and Lam Tin.  The ages of the suspects varied, but they were all between the ages of 20 and 50 years.  The amount of heroin found during each seizure also varied greatly with busts as small as 250 grams but no larger than 10 kilograms.

The maximum penalty for the offense of "trafficking in a dangerous drug" is a $5 million fine and life imprisonment.


 One branch of the Customs and Excise Department is the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau. Along with the Narcotics Bureau, they seek to eradicate dealing in narcotics. One of their biggest targets is heroin trade, smuggling, manufacture, and distribution. By tracking suspicious persons and setting ambushes, many drug manufacturing centres have been uncovers and smashed. Police have also made seizures off private persons, in particular intercepting smugglers at airports and customs control points. Those persons intercepted at these places most often have slabs of heroin strapped to their bodies. Much of the heroin seized was believed to be for distribution in the Kowloon area. The Bureaus have seen an increase in their rates of success, and the amount of heroin seized in Hong Kong has risen by 100 kilograms in the past year, without an increase in drug demand. Instead, the Central Registry for Drug Abuse Records reports a decrease in drug abusers for the same period of time. The Bureau chiefs credit good strategy and intelligence work by officers for this increased success. Those trafficking in heroin can be charged with "Trafficking in Dangerous Drug," which carries a maximum penalty of $5 million and life imprisonment.
