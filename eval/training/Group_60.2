The Customs and Excise Department contributes significantly to law and order in society and the economic well-being of Hong Kong. It is committed to the enforcement of 48 different pieces of legislation, such as the protection of revenue on dutiable commodities, the detection of drug trafficking and smuggling, and the protection of intellectual property rights. The Department has been repeatedly praised for its excellance in discharging these duties, and its professionalism and dedication. It has sustained efforts to maintain Hong Kong as a separate customs territory after its return to China, thus ensuring the success of the "one country, two systems" policy.
