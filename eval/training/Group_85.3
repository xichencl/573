There have been several changes in public transportation, specifically with regards to ferries.

Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) had contracts to operate several different ferry routes through the end of March 1999.  The Transportation Department (TD) in late 1998, invited operators to bid for these and other routes. Many changes in management resulted.

The objective of the tender exercise is to let market forces determine their viability, fare and service levels.

In addition to changes in management, there were also some fare changes.  The new licenses took effect in April 1999, the fare changes in April 2000.  most of them were increases.
