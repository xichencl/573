Charitable non-profits can raise funds on Government-approved Flag Days.

In order to hold a flag day, non-profits must apply to the government a year in advance. The organization must prove in its application its worthiness, its financial needs, and its ability to organize a flag day. To qualify as a government-recognized non-profit, it must fall within one of the following categories: relief of poverty; advancement of education; advancement of religion; or other charitable purposes.
