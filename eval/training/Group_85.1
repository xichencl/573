 Most ferry services were provided by Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Co.Ltd. (HYF) and Hong Kong Kowloon Ferry Company (HKK) until March 31, 1999 when New World First Ferry Services Ltd. (NWFF) took over all HYF routes.  
 In 1998 the Trasport Department announced that licenses to operate various ferry routes would be awarded to Discovery Bay Transportation, HKK, and HYF. The licenses were for a period of three years, and were given based on a tender exercise,designed to let market forces determine the viability, fare and service levels. The TD received eight bids from six companies when the tender closed on November 20.
