Despite a general decline in drug abuse over the past few years, the government remains committed to addressing the persistent problems posed by drugs. 

The Action Committee Against Narcotics has commissioned studies on the treatment of drug abusers.  The studies seek to illuminate the cause of chronic drug abuse and relapse after treatment, as well as the best motivational strategy for use during treatment.

To educate the public on the hazards of drugs, the ACAN has proposed a drug information center, along with other publicity measures.

The government also plans to require anyone running a drug treatment or rehabilitation program to apply for registration.
