Due to violent crimes in Hong Kong, rewards are given for information on the relevant cases. The rewards are either given to any person, or apportioned amongst persons, giving information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the culprit. Anyone who has information on the cases is urged to report to any police officer.
 For instance, the police were offering a reward of $500,000 for information leading to the detection of a murder and robbery case wherein an Auxiliary Police Officer was attacked and later died in Shek Kip Mei in 1993.
About 9 am on September 1993, the Auxiliary Police Constable was attacked.


 In an attempt to eliminate violent crime, Hong Kong Police are offering large rewards for information about them.

In one case, police are offering $230 thousand for information leading to the arrest of a group of suspected robbers.

The types of crimes for which the rewards are being offered are murder, homicide, rape, arson and robbery.  The award money amount range from $50 thousand to $500 thousand.

Anyone who has information on the case is urged to report to any Police Officer, Police Station, or call the Police Hotline 2527 7177, or write to General Post Office Box No.999 or by E-mail to crimeinf@police.gcn.gov.hk.


 In an effort to gain further information on criminal cases, the Hong Kong police department has issued to the public many appeals for information. Information supplied by an individual that leads to solving a criminal case will be rewarded; the rewards range from $50,000 - $500,000. The appeals include the type of criminal act (murder, rape, robbery, and arson), details about the act (date, location, time, victim(s)), and a description of the suspect(s). Many of the criminal acts occured several years ago and are stalled cases, thus the public appeal. For the most part, the murders are the result of an armed robbery.
