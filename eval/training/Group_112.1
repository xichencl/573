The Provisional Urban Council recently announced several free carnivals and festive social events open to the public. 

Perhaps the most spectacular event occured when thousands gathered to share in a lantern carnival, but others include Wushu Carnival, a Dance Carnival, a Sports and Games Carnival, and more in a continuing series of lantern carnivals.

Visitors to all the carnivals will also be treated to a wide spectrum of entertainment programs, including street acrobatics by strolling artists in costume, lantern riddles, Beijing operas, Chinese instrumental performance, puppet show, vaudeville show, fortune telling, and demonstrations of traditional arts and crafts.
