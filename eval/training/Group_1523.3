The Young Athlete Training Scheme is looking for applicants. The sports for which young athletes can apply are swimming, badminton, football, basketball, and table tennis.  The main objective of the Youth Athlete Training Scheme is to enhance training at the district level, while identifying athletes with potential to refer them for further training. The scheme also provides training for coaches and referees.

To apply, applicants should be proficient in the basic skills of their sport, and must go through screening tests before being accepted for training. Applications for the scheme are available at offices of the Regional Services Department.
