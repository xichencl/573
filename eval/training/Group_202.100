Several dialogues between the Legislative Council and various secretaries including Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands, Secretary for the Environment and Food, Secretary for Health and Welfare; as well as statements made to the press by the Government Land Trasport Agency (GLTA) seek to promote the image of a government that considers environmental protection a top priority.

There are a wide range of on-going and new measures aimed at reducing the amount of air-pollution caused by automobiles. These include:the move towards Liquefied Petroleum Gas vehicles, increased education, increased public transportation, more stringent emmissions standards, and promoting pedestrianisation.

 Following a rise in air pollution levels in Hong Kong last winter, several notably inquiries were made regarding the assesment and plan of action of the Government.  Primary among the indications of higher levels of air pollution was the Air Pollution Indexes taken by the Environmental Protection Department.   Around Decmeber 30 of last year, the Air Pollution Indexes reached record levels.

The inquiries of distinguished individuals prompted replies from the Secretary for the Environment and Food and the Secretary for Planning Environment and Lands citing the tightening of emission standards and the use of alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas.
 To improve local air quality, the Hong Kong government is helping vehicles switch to more efficient fuels, monitoring levels of industrial pollution, and providing civic education on pollution problems.  

The government is planning to offer grants to owners of taxis and light buses to switch to more efficient LPG fuel. For diesel vehicles, particulate traps and catalytic converters will be provided.

For industrial sources of emission, natural gas has been introduced for power generation in Hong Kong, and coal plants have been required to reduce harmful emissions.

The government is also educating vehicle service professionals and the general public on air pollution.
