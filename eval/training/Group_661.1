 EC was asked by the Chief Executive in his first Policy Address to undertake a thorough review of the education system in Hong Kong to see how it should develop in the 21st century. 
 The Chairman of the Education Commission (EC), the Hon Antony Leung, announced the outcome of the consultation.   "...the community want educational reform. The present system is considered too examination-oriented, with too much emphasis on rote-learning. It can no longer meet the needs of Hong Kong. The public also generally agree with the aims of education as stated, although some want the aims to be more specific and measurable."
