During the period from July to September 1999 in Hong Kong, the unemployment and underemployment rates were 6.1% and 3.1% respectively.  These numbers were obtained from a continuous general household survey  The unemployment rate reflects an increase in decoration and maintenance, transport, wholesale trade and hotels which offset decreases in  communications and business services.  Although the number of people in the labor force increased in this period from earlier months, the number of people employed decreased.

The unemployment and underemployment rates in Hong Kong during the 1998-99 year have varied greatly.  Both numbers reached lows of 3.9% and 2.2% (unemployment and underemployment, respectfully) during the period of February to April 1998.  The unemployment rate was at a high of 6.3% during the period from February to April 1999.  The underemployment rate reached a high of 3.1% during the periods between July and September of 1999 as well as during the November 1998 to January 1999 period.

The government has taken many steps to improve the unemployment rates such as undertaking projects that would create thousands of new jobs.  There have also been skill training programs for both unemployed adults as well as for children that have been met with enthusiasm.


  In 1998 the Hong Kong government made a sustained effor to tackle unemployment problems. The provisional seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the period April - June 1998 was 4.5%, and the provisional underemployment rate was 2.6%. Comparing this period with March-May 1998, the increase in the unemployment rate occurred mainly in the retail, restaurants and construction sectors. 
 Given this the government initiated a series of measures to ease unemployment. These measures included strengthening the Labour Department's Job Matching Programme, and providing a telephone job matching service and vacancy processing service for job-seekers.
 Attending these measures were decreases in the unemployment rate. These decreases in unemployment rate were seen mainly in the construction, manufacturing, import/export trades, hotels, transport, real estate and insurance sectors. As to the underemployment rate, decreases were seen in the decoration and maintenance, manufacturing, transport and restaurants secotrs. 
 Mr K Y Tang, the Government Economist, observed that as business conditions gradually improved, the labour market also benefited, and both the unemployment and the underemployment rates fell in the aforementioned period.
However, he cautioned that with more fresh graduates the unemployment rate especially for younger persons would probably remain relatively high in the near term.
 The Asian financial crisis in 1998 created high unemployment rates in Hong Kong. As unemployment rates rose, the Government had been implementing a wide-ranging series of measures to help the unemployed to rejoin the workforce and equip them with the requisite skills to stay competitive in the labour market. The Labour Department is providing a full range of strengthened services to help unemployed job-seekers find jobs, particularly through the Job Matching Programme, and providing a telephone job-matching service and vacancy processing service for job-seekers. Extensive training courses, both long- and short-term were also offered by the Vocational Training Council, which aided the unemployed in retraining and skills upgrading; also, the Employees Retraining Board increased its training capacity and expenditures. The Government awarded and pushed along dozens of new major public works projects, which creates thousands of new jobs. Hundreds of Small and Medium Enterprises have been approved for loans under the Special Financial Scheme, which should help relieve the liquidity problems which many businesses face. As summer advanced, rising numbers of tourists in Hong Kong aided the economy, creating a demand for new employees; however, recent college graduates entering the job market increased the labour supply.
