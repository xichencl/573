Good health and hygiene is being promoted through program participation and rewards.

The Provisional Urban Council (PUC) Ambassadors of Hygiene is a title awarded annually to 24 students who present exceptional written projects on health.  The competition, is divided into three categories. 8 winners are selected from each group. The winners are named at an award ceremony.  Then the ambassadors go to Japan to discuss public health with Japanese officials.
