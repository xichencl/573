Government health officials have been on guard for influenza strains that include influenza H3N2 virus, of swine origin, influenza A H5N1 and H9N2, transmitted from birds.

Department of Health's Consultant on Community Medicine Dr Mak Kwok-hang did not think there was cause for undue alarm but emphasized the importance of maintaining vigilant influenza surveillance.
 Control measures on the avian flu were declared effective by experts. No new cases of influenza A H5N1 occured in Hong Kong for almost a year. Action taken by the Hong Kong Government in December 1997 might have saved the world from an influenza pandemic.
One action taken was a mass poultry slaughter.



 Hong Kong has been responding to the problem of avian influenza.

The Department of Health's influenza surveillance has been extended to all public hospitals and outpatient clinics.  Scientists have discovered that avian flu is primarily transmitted from poultry to humans.  The public are reminded to use good hygiene, especially near bird products.
