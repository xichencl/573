The Elderly Commission met several times this month to discuss a wide range of issues concerning the residential care of the elderly.  Primary among issues of concern is the consideration for more private residential care facilities, increasing the number of available places, and therefore shortening waiting time.  Another commonly suggested solution requires the adoption of new criteria for determining the eligibility of elderly persons for placement residential care homes.

The inquiries of several distinguished individuals prompted a response from the Secretary for Health and Welfare in the Legislative Council.  The Secretary for Health and Welfare cited past effort and continued commitment.
