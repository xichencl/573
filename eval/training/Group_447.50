The Housing Authority (HA) has taken steps to make renting and buying homes easier.

The Chief Executive in Council approved resale restrictions for flats sold under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) and Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS).

The HA also took measures to ensure early recovery of public rental housing under home ownership schemes.


 The Housing Authority's Home Ownership Committee (HOC) has relaxed many restrictions on flat purchase and rental, such as a shortened resale restriction period of Home Ownership Scheme flats, which helps promote mobility on both open and secondary HOS markets and recovery of rental flats for allocation to needy families.
  Resale restriction period for HOS/Private Sector Participation Scheme flats was shortened to enhance the attractiveness of HOS and help promote mobility of flats in the open market and the secondary HOS market. Government intended that through activities in the secondary HOS market, more rental flats can be recovered for allocation to needy families.
