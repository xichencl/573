As a result of tendering out the ferry services as eight separate packages, the current franchise by the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) will terminate on March 31, 1999, and the outlying island, new town and inner harbour ferry services as well as "Star" Ferry's Central - Hung Hom service will be operated as licensed services by five ferry operators: HYF, "Star" Ferry, Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry Company Limited (HKK), Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited (DBTSL) and Shun Tak Ferries Limited. The multiple franchises leads to enhanced competition and helps the Transport Department contract the most suitable ferry service operators.
