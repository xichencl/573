Official representatives of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have made several important visits with senior officials in Beijing to discuss subjects of mutual concern between the central government of the People's Republic of China and the SAR. These meetings helped to enhance the communication and understanding between the two governments and accomodate a smooth relationship after the Handover. Both sides acknowledged that given the immense differences in the legal and judicial systems in the Mainland and the HKSAR, the subject is very complicated. Under the "one country, two systems" principle, it was agreed that Hong Kong would continue to have autonomy.
