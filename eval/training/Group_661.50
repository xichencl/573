 EC was asked by the Chief Executive in his first Policy Address to undertake a thorough review of the education system in Hong Kong.
 The Chairman of the Education Commission announced the outcome of the consultation.   "...the community want[s] educational reform. The present system is... too examination-oriented, with too much emphasis on rote-learning."
 The EC held meetings at which they discussed performing a review of the country's academic structure.  They vowed to take a look at the goals of education and the aims of different education stages.  

In Hong Kong, education accounts for 21% of government spending.  For the 2000-2001 Budget, the government set aside $800 million.

 In light of a clear need for educational reform, the Education Commission (EC) has been asked to begin a thorough review of the structure of all levels of education, addressing the age at which students should begin each stage of education, the duration and interface of various stages, the curriculum and methods of assessment.
