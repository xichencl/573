Territory-wide joint operations against illegal immigration, mounted by the Police, Immigration, and Labour Departments, has resulted in many arrests. These operations are part of the Hong Kong Government's continuous effort to flush out illegal immigrants. The suspected illegal immigrants that were arrested by the Police have been referred to the Immigration Department, and those found to be illegal immigrants will be repatriated. A Government spokesman reiterated that there was no question of any amnesty for illegal immigrants. During the 24-hour operations, the Police stepped up their identification spot checks in public places and carried out checks at suspicious locations throughout the territory; thousands of people were stopped for random identification checks. Apart from continuous checks throughout the territory, there was no let-up in anti-illegal immigration efforts at the border. A high state of vigilance will continue to be maintained by the Police and the security forces both at the land and sea borders. The Labour Department inspected establishments to weed out any illegal immigrants who may be working there and to check that employers fulfill their legal obligation of keeping proper records of their employees. The spokesman reminded employers that there were heavy penalties if they were found to be employing illegal immigrants.

 In an effort to curb illegal immigration, the Police, Immigration Department and Labour Department have set up many anti-immigration operations.

Security checkpoints were set up in many public places as well as some locations that were suspected of being high traffic areas for illegal immigrants.  At the security checkpoints, the police checked identification cards of anywhere between 10,000 and 30,000 people.  Operations at these checkpoints usually resulted in between 50 and 200 arrests.  The arrested individuals were both men and women.  Some were illegal immigrants, some were once-legal residents who had stayed in the country beyond what they were originally granted,  others were legal residents who had breached their condition of stay. Still others were legal residents who had helped in harboring or employed illegal immigrants.

In addition to the public checkpoints, Immigration investigators also visited residential premises, restaurants, business establishments and other well known hideouts for illegal immigrants.  These visits usually resulted in the arrests of both illegal immigrants and legal residents who aided or employed them.

All illegal immigrants found either at the checkpoints or elsewhere will be repatriated.  The maximum penalty for employing illegal immigrants is a $350,000 fine plus three years imprisonment.

  A Hong Kong, territory-wide operation against illegal immigration jointly mounted by the Police, Immigration Department and Labour Department has resulted in the arrests of 202 people. The operation is part of the Government's continuous effort to flush out illegal immigrants. The 66 suspected illegal immigrants arrested by the Police have been referred to the Immigration Department.
Those found to be illegal immigrants will be repatriated. In December 1998, a government spokesman reiterated that there was no question of any amnesty for illegal immigrants.
"Our latest operation should drive home the point that there will be no change to this policy. Anyone foolish enough to believe otherwise is only cheating oneself," he said. The spokesman stressed that apart from continuous checks throughout the territory, there was no let-up in anti-illegal immigration efforts at the border.

On the labour front, inspectors of the Labour Department visited 3,148 establishments to weed out any illegal immigrants who may be working there and to check that employers fulfil their legal obligation of keeping proper records. A total of 7,375 employees had their proof of identity checked and six establishments were unable to provide a record of employees for inspection.

This is just one instance of the ongoing policy.
