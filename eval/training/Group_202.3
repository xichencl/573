To improve local air quality, the Hong Kong government is helping vehicles switch to more efficient fuels, monitoring levels of industrial pollution, and providing civic education on pollution problems.  

The government is planning to offer grants to owners of taxis and light buses to switch to more efficient LPG fuel. For diesel vehicles, particulate traps and catalytic converters will be provided.

For industrial sources of emission, natural gas has been introduced for power generation in Hong Kong, and coal plants have been required to reduce harmful emissions.

The government is also educating vehicle service professionals and the general public on air pollution.
