In an attempt to eliminate violent crime, Hong Kong Police are offering large rewards for information about them.

In one case, police are offering a reward of $230 thousand for information leading to the arrest of a group of suspected robbers who robbed watch company on the ground floor at 162 Des Voeux Road Central, Waterfront.  The culprits along with a third watchman made off with 73 watches with a total value of more than $2 million.

For another robbery that took place in Tsuen Wan, police are offering $100 thousand for information.  In this case two security guards on cash escort duty were robbed by three culprits outside a bank at 201 - 207 Castle Peak Road.  The robbers got away with $800 thousand from the cash box and a shotgun.

The types of crimes for which the rewards are being offered are murder, homicide, rape, arson and robbery.  The award money amount range from $50 thousand to $500 thousand.

Anyone who has information on the case is urged to report to any Police Officer, Police Station, or call the Police Hotline 2527 7177, or write to General Post Office Box No.999 or by E-mail to crimeinf@police.gcn.gov.hk.

 In an effort to gain further information on criminal cases, the Hong Kong police department has issued to the public many appeals for information. Information supplied by an individual that leads to solving a criminal case will be rewarded; the rewards range from $50,000 - $500,000. The appeals include the type of criminal act (murder, rape, robbery, and arson), details about the act (date, location, time, victim(s)), and a description of the suspect(s). Many of the criminal acts occured several years ago and are stalled cases, thus the public appeal. Most of the rewards are nearer to $100,000, although the robbery and subsequent murder of an Auxiliary Police Officer pulls the highest reward of $500,000. For the most part, the murders are the result of an armed robbery.

Anyone who knows the whereabouts of the culprit or has information on the case can contact any Police Officer, Police Station, or call the Police Hotline 2527 7177, or send a letter to General Post Office Box No.999 or send by E-mail at crimeinf@police.gcn.gov.hk.

The reward will be paid either in full or pro-rata, to any person, or apportioned amongst persons, giving information leading to the arrest and satisfactory prosecution of the culprit.

 For instance, the police were offering a reward of $500,000 for information leading to the detection of a murder and robbery case in which an Auxiliary Police Officer was attacked and later died in Shek Kip Mei in 1993.
About 9 am on September 12, 1993, the Auxiliary Police Constable was attacked by knife-wielding culprit(s) at the entrance of Block 17, Pak Tin Estate. Sustaining multiple stab wounds, he later died in a hospital. His service revolver loaded with six rounds of ammunitions was snatched during the attack. Police are looking for a man aged about 26 to 30 in connection with the case. He is about 1.6 metres tall, about 70 to 75 kilograms in weight, of slightly fat build, with a round face and fair complexion.
He was last seen wearing a dark coloured T-shirt, black sleeveless anorak with four pockets in the front and blue jeans.
