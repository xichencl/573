If police officers got paid by the ticket, then I'm sure that Eastern Traffic Day is their favorite day of the year.  On this day between 8 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon, police are out in large numbers strictly enforcing traffic laws that often go ignored.  Most often, the police patrol areas that are well-known for major traffic problems.  

Officers from Eastern District Headquarters, North Point Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Chai Wan Division and Eastern District Traffic Team were deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district.  Usually 20-30 officers are deployed to carry-out the operation.
