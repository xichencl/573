 The Management Board of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority endorsed at its meeting the MPFA Corporate Plan 2000-2001 and proposed amendments to the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Regulation. Programmes and activities outlined in the MPFA Corporate Plan were constructed with the mission and target of the MPFA in mind. "Our mission is to ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's workforce and our target is to implement the MPF System in December. Everybody in the MPFA is devoted to work towards this mission and target," said  Charles Lee Yeh-kwong.
 Also, The commencement date for MPF contributions should remain unchanged on December 1, 2000 as previously scheduled, members of the MPFA Management Board agreed at a meeting today.

The MPFA Chairman, the Hon. Charles Lee Yeh-kwong, said the MPFA had reviewed the readiness of the community, the industry and the MPFA itself and the conclusion was that all the parties concerned would be ready for the full implementation of the MPF System in December 2000. The MPFA will recommend to the Executive Council on the commencement date and will propose to bring into effect all the other legislative provisions necessary for the smooth operation of the MPF System.







 For the year 2000-2001 The Mandatory Provident Fund's mission according to chairman Charles Lee Yeh-kwong was to "Ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's work force."

In a meeting a couple of years earlier, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) endorsed a set of  guidelines to help service providers in complying with the MPF legislation. The guidelines were on:

Application for Approval as Trustees, which specify the forms for application for approval as MPF trustees and the information and documents to be submitted;  Application for Registration of Provident Fund Schemes, which relate to the application for registration of employer sponsored schemes and master trust schemes under the MPF Schemes Ordinance; and criteria and requirements with respect to custodians of MPF assets and eligible insurers providing insurance cover for registered MPF schemes; and MPF approved funds.

Each year, the MPFA accepts applications for approval of MPF corporate trustees from insurance companies, banks and investment houses and applications for MPF exemption from Occupational Retirement Schemes.

In 2000 the MPFA decided to set December 1 as the date for commencing MPF contributions.  The timetable allowed 11 months for employers to enroll their staff into MPF schemes before the commencement of contributions in December 2000.


 The mission of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) is to ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's workforce. From 1998-2000, the MPFA worked to implement the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (MPF) System in December of 2000. They asked that all employers register for an MPF scheme, unless exempted under MPF requirements of existing retirement schemes under the Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance (ORSO). One of the key tasks before full implementation of the System is the processing of applications for exemption. During the year 2000-2001, the MPFA will perform as the registration authority and the regulator of ORSO schemes and MPF schemes. The MPFA will act as the lead regulator and co-ordinator, and rely on several other government monetary agencies for the licensing and supervision of MPF intermediaries. The likely increase in the operating costs of most businesses arising from the implementation of the MPF system will be modest, and it is expected that employers will seek to contain impact through adoption of more efficient production techniques and other management arrangements. On public awareness, the Government and the MPFA have distributed millions of explanatory pamplet. A territory-wide operation will reach out to thousands of shops with a package of publicity materials.
