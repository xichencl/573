The Housing Authority (HA) has taken several steps to make renting and buying homes easier.

The Chief Executive in Council approved amended resale restrictions for flats sold under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) and Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS) to bring them in line with those approved for Tenants Purchase Scheme (TPS) flats.  To provide greater flexibility to HOS flat owners, the ten-year resale restriction period was shortened to five years. The accessibility of single persons to home ownership was also enhanced.

The HA also took measures to ensure early recovery of public rental housing flats under various home ownership schemes.
