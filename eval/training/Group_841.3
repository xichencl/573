In an effort to gain further information on criminal cases, the Hong Kong police department has issued to the public many appeals for information. Information supplied by an individual that leads to solving a criminal case will be rewarded; the rewards range from $50,000 - $500,000. The appeals include the type of criminal act (murder, rape, robbery, and arson), details about the act (date, location, time, victim(s)), and a description of the suspect(s). Many of the criminal acts occured several years ago and are stalled cases, thus the public appeal. For the most part, the murders are the result of an armed robbery.
