Customs officials are continuing to crack down on the production of pirated optical discs.  Several raids on production centers and the interception of the people involved have served to reinforce Hong Kong's commitment to intellectual property rights.

During raids, officers act on information obtained from investigations, stopping production units and seizing the pirated goods.  The individuals responsible are arrested.  In an anti-piracy operation codenamed "Thunderbolt", Customs officers raided 411 shops, seized optical discs worth a total of 32 million dollars, and made 320 arrests.  Materials seized at the raids include VCDs, CD Roms, music CDs, discs of Japanese TV dramas, DVDs, MP3 discs, and video games.

Seizure of pirated discs has also been carried out at airports and seaports.  Smuggled optical discs have been discovered coming into Hong Kong from surrounding nations.  Customs officers have been vigilant in monitoring all imported goods to prevent smuggling of pirated discs.  In the first nine months of 1998, officers seized 500,000 pirated optical discs from incoming vessels.

The government reminds the public that the maximum penalty for selling pirated items is a fine of $50,000 per disc and four years in prison.  Customs pledges to continue its work to support intellectual property rights.


 In an on-going effort to protect intellectual property rights and maintain a good image of Hong Kong, Customs officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau have stepped up their efforts against piracy actions.

By either mouting investigations and cracking down on storage centers and syndicates, or by inspecting suspicious cargo at the airport, Customs officers have continued their efforts to combat piracy activities by reducing the number and circulation of pirated optical discs.

Often, the raids result in the destruction of storage and distribution centers as well as the arrest of one or more persons involved. According to the Copyright Ordinance, anyone who is found selling any pirated article is liable to prosecution. The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $50,000 per disc and four years' imprisonment.

The pirated optical discs take on a several formats: VCDs (often of Japanese drama series), MP3 discs, television game discs, DVDs, CD Roms, and music CDs.

A spokesperson for the Customs and Excise Department said the department would continue to take vigorous enforcement action against piracy activities. The on-going anti-piracy operations demonstrate the Government's determination in combating piracy activities and preserving the good image of Hong Kong, the spokesperson added.
