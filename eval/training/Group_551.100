Oxfam Hong Kong, World Vision Hong Kong, the United Nations Children's Fund, Hong Kong Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and Medecins Sans Frontieres are the organizatons who have received grants from the Advisory Committee to provide relief.  In mainland China, recent floods have summoned the services of Hong Kong relief organizations.  Floods in North Korea and Bangladesh have also attracted funds from Hong Kong.   To ensure that the money given to them will be used for the purpose designated, relief organizations must submit evaluation forms and audited accounts.

 The Hong Kong Government is committed to providing disaster relief for flood victims. Programs like UNICEF and Hong Kong's Red cross have recieved grants.

Over the course of several years, the Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee have approved millions of dollars for aid to countries including Bangladesh and North Korea. Additionally, other relief projects include aid to Hunan, Sichuan, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, Hubei and Jiangxi.

The Committee is chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration. The committee includes the Secretary for Health and Welfare and the Secretary for the Treasury, among others.



 The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee approves grants to aid flood victims.
Between the months of July and November of 1998, many grants were sent for emergency relief. Grants were sent to the Mainland, North Korea, and Bangladesh. North Korea has suffered continued hardship brought about by floods and droughts over the past few years. Bangladesh and the Mainland have been affected by recent flooding.
The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee has given grants to United Nations Children's Fund, Medicins Sans Frontieres, and Salvation Army, hoping that the grants can help to provide some immediate relief to the victims affected by the recent floods.
