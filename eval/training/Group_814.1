Customs officers of the General Investigation Division have been busy in their constant efforts in combating smuggling activities. The Anti-Cigarette-Smuggling Task Force and Customs Marine and Land Enforcement Command are also involved.
There has been an increasing trend of using river trade vessels to smuggle cigarettes into Hong Kong. Customs is monitoring the situation closely and will devise appropriate enforcement strategy to stem this illicit flow.
The Department will continue their anti-cigarette smuggling operations to smash distribution centers of contraband cigarettes. It will continue its vigorous enforcement actions to check the supply of dutiable cigarettes to show the determination in protecting public revenue.
