Territory-wide joint operations against illegal immigration, mounted by the Police, Immigration, and Labour Departments, has resulted in many arrests. These operations are part of the Hong Kong Government's continuous effort to flush out illegal immigrants. The suspected illegal immigrants that were arrested by the Police have been referred to the Immigration Department, and those found to be illegal immigrants will be repatriated. A Government spokesman reiterated that there was no question of any amnesty for illegal immigrants. During the 24-hour operations, the Police stepped up their identification spot checks in public places and carried out checks at suspicious locations throughout the territory.
