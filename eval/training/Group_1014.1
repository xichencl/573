In an effort to curb traffic offenses, the Eastern District Police regularly conduct Eastern Traffic Days. During a period from 8 am to 4 pm on a weekday, usually a Wednesday, Thursday, or a Friday, police officers from Eastern District Headquarters, North Point Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Chai Wan Division and Eastern District Traffic Team are deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district. They issue fixed penalty tickets for illegal parking and other traffic offenses, and dispense summonses for jay-walkers. They also cautioned many other pedestrians and drivers for minor traffic offenses.
