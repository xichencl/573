Nine not for profit organizations were given the right to have flag days.  This is a day when the organization can sell flags or tokens to raise money. Also, they can place donation boxes in designated public locations.

In order to hold a flag day, the organization must apply to the Social Welfare Department (SWD) by a given deadline and the organization must be a non-profit organization.  Each application is considered by the Subventions and Lotteries Fund Advisoty Committee.  Applications are available at the SWD Headquarter office.

Most flag days are held on Saturday, although some are held on Wednesdays.
