 In 1999-2000, Customs officers conducted a number, over 115, of successful raids in Mong Kok and other areas. 61 people, including 16 buyers, were arrested. Over 3.1 million sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized. 
 
 In the attempt to stem sale of illicit cigarettes, a Customs Anti-Illicit Cigarette Task Force (CTF) was established in April 2000 and was charged with stepping up enforcement actions against illicit cigarette activities both at the supply and retail level.

 At the retail level, members of the CTF and Customs officers conducted a joint operation in April 2000, aimed at cracking down illicit cigarette activities at street level.
