The Government and District Fire Safety Committees will continue to work together to enhance fire safety awareness. 
The Deputy Director of Home Affairs, Mr. Lui Hau-tuen reported that there are District Fire Safety Committees (DFSCs) set up in all districts by the Home Affair Department. The DFSCs organize publicity and educational activities about fire safety as well as building managment, and they also plan to provide an informational newsletter and pamphlets. New fire safety legislation is part of the comprehensive improvement program to enhance fire safety.  The aim is to not only increase awareness and inspections, but enforcement action as well.
