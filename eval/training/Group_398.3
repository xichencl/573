Following confirmed cases of several different strains of the influenza virus, Government health officials have been on guard.  The influenza H3N2 virus isolated from a 10 month-old girl who was treated at Tuen Mun Hospital for fever and influenza like illness last month was of swine origin.  Other strains include influenza A H5N1, which has occurred in Hong Kong for almost a year, and influenza A H9N2, both primarily transmitted from birds or ducks, and therefore called the avian flu.

While the modes of transmission require more study, it seems for both types the human to human transmission rate remains low.
