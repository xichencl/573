 In preparation for a 60-member Legislative Council that made up of 20 seats to be returned from 5 geographical constituencies, 30 seats from 28 functional constituencies and 10 seats from the 800-member Election Committee, which will be formed through subsector elections in early April 1998, the Registration and Electoral Office has received 305,000 application forms for voter registration and report of change of residential address of registered electors since a voter registration drive started on January 17, 2000. An initial assessment finds that more than half of the forms are from first time voters and 40% of those are young people.
