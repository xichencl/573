The Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee has approved several grants for emergency relief to flood victims.

Oxfam Hong Kong, World Vision Hong Kong, the United Nations Children's Fund, Hong Kong Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and Medecins Sans Frontieres are the organizatons who have received grants from the Advisory Committee to provide relief.  In mainland China, recent floods have summoned the services of Hong Kong relief organizations.  Floods in North Korea and Bangladesh have also attracted funds from Hong Kong.   To ensure that the money given to them will be used for the purpose designated, relief organizations must submit evaluation forms and audited accounts.
