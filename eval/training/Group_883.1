  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) along with the Urban Services Department, in efforts to stem cholera and safeguard public health, have mounted blitz operations against unlicensed food factories selling snacks and cooked food in Mong Kok district. There has been proliferation of these small scale food factories that sell snacks and cooked food, specifically, shellfish, non-bottled drinks and Siu Mei and Lo Mei, in sub-divided shop units. Most of these premises are not qualified for a food licence and their hygiene standards are poor, often storing food in open spaces and preparing food on the pavement in front of these shops.
