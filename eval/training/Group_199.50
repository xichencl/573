Customs Commissioner, Mr.John Tsang Chun-wah assured that Customs is committed to intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and will continue to maintain Hong Kong as a pirate-free zone.

For 1997 and 1998 Hong Kong has remained on the "Watch List" of the United States Trade Representative's _Special 301 Report_ on the protection of IPR.
 As intellectual property rights protection is an essential element in the development of trade, investment and technology transfer, Hong Kong has implemented strong measures to fight copyright piracy. Hong Kong's approach to combatting the problem involves legislation, enforcement, education and cooperation with intellectual property rights owners.
 Due to the actions of the Customs department, optical disc piracy in Hong Kong has been on the decline. Customs' ability to enforce against piracy was strengthened by the Copyright Ordinance and the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance.  However, the US still listed Hong Kong on an intellectual property watch list in 1998.
