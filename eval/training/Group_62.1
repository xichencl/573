Hong Kong was quick to tackle the problem of non-Y2K-compliant computer systems. The Global 2000 Co-ordinating Group, which monitored compliance work around the world, gave Hong Kong one of the highest ratings for Y2K readiness. The Government spent millions of dollars upgrading and patching software and hardware on dozens of systems, reaching full readiness by October. Contingency plans were also in place to ensure that essential services to the public will not be disrupted, and the public was informed of the possible impact of Y2K. As a result of this extensive preparation, no problematic incidents occured.
