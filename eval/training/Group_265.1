Following several confirmed cases cholera, Hong Kong health officials have been on guard.  As many as ten local cases of cholera have been recently confirmed.  

Chair of a meeting of the Inter-departmental Co-ordinating Committee on the Prevention and Control of Cholera, Deputy Director of Health, Dr. Paul Saw suspected the leading factors in the ten recent local cases include inadequately cooked shellfish, inadequately reheated food, and the cross contamination of raw and cooked food.
