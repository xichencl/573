The Asian financial crisis in 1998 created high unemployment rates in Hong Kong. As unemployment rates rose, the Government had been implementing a wide-ranging series of measures to help the unemployed to rejoin the workforce and equip them with the requisite skills to stay competitive in the labour market. It also created thousands of jobs through major new public works projects. The Labour Department is providing a full range of strengthened services to help unemployed job-seekers find jobs, particularly through its extended Job Matching Programme. Extensive training courses were offered by the Vocational Training Council, which aided the unemployed in retraining and skills upgrading.
