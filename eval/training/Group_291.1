For each government election, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) held registration drives that increased registered voters and assured accurate voter registration information. The drive included door-to-door visits by volunteers to assist in registering every eligible voter. A large percentage of new voters are young people aged between 18 and 25. Once the registers have been compiled, it is important for individuals to check their registration particulars and to make corrections or lodge appeals regarding any entry. Both the provisional and final registers of electors are printed and displayed in key locations such as the REO and District Offices for public inspection.
