Hong Kong has braced itself and it ready for any curve balls that the turn of the century may throw its way.

Many business and organizations have reported a proposed state of total or near readiness.  

Of all  agencies examined,  Customs Clearance and operations was the only organization not affected by the Y2K scare.

 The organization of a Central Co-ordinating Center to ensure quick responses to Year 2000-induced incidents and the efforts of the Information Technology Services Department regarding the readiness for the rollover to the new millennium were part of a successful contingency plan by the Hong Kong government.
 Hong Kong responded quickly to the problem of non-Y2K-compliant computer systems. The Government spent millions of dollars upgrading and patching software and hardware on dozens of systems, and also enhancing public awareness of the possible impact of the Y2K problem. As a result of this extensive preparation, no problematic incidents occured.
