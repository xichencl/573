In an effort to curb traffic offenses, the Eastern District Police regularly conduct Eastern Traffic Days. During a period from 8 am to 4 pm police officers are deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district, where they issue tickets and summonses for offenses such as illegal parking and jaywalking.
  Eastern District Police officers issued 126 penalty tickets and 33 summonses against road users violating traffic regulations during an operation conducted between 8 am and 4 pm on May 26, 1999. 26 officers were deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district. This was one of many such operations.

 On Eastern Traffic Day between the hours of 8 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon, police are out in large numbers strictly enforcing traffic laws that often go ignored.  Most often, the police officers patrol areas that are well-known for having major traffic problems.
