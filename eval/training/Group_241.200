The Government and District Fire Safety Committees will continue to work together to enhance fire safety awareness. 
The Deputy Director of Home Affairs, Mr. Lui Hau-tuen reported that there are District Fire Safety Committees (DFSCs) set up in all districts by the Home Affair Department. The DFSCs organize publicity and educational activities about fire safety as well as building managment, and they also plan to provide an informational newsletter and pamphlets.  Some of the themes of the exibitions are "Neighbourhood Assistance," "Fire Safety begins with you," and "Fire Safety begins at Home."  The Fire Services Department supports new fire safety legeslation which is being introduced by the government. The legislation is part of the comprehensive improvement program to enhance fire safety, according to Mrs. Regina Ip, the Secretary for Security.  The aim is to not only increase awareness and inspections, but enforcement action as well.  Special concerns regarding fire safety are in cubicle apartment buildings and office buildings with cubicles, as well as dry weather. Therefore the Fire Services Department will be doing more inspections and encouraging awareness of fire-hazards. As the dry season increases fire risk, older buildings are receiving special attention from the Buildings Department and Labour Department.
 The Hong Kong Government is tackling the issue of fire safety with a comibination of legislation, inspections, and community awareness.

The Government will introduce legislation to extend the scope of the Fire Safety Ordinance to require the installation of additional fire service equipment and improvements to building structure in old commercial buildings.

Enforcement action to require compliance with existing legislation will continue to be stepped up. The Fire Services Department (FSD) has statutory power under the Fire Services Ordinance to abate fire hazards, the overwhelming majority of which exist in the common parts of buildings.

Examples of fire hazards include obstruction to means of escape, and defective or missing fire service installations and equipment.

The FSD, the Buildings Department, and the Labour Department have all increased fire safety inspections.

The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department will step up inspection of electrical installation in buildings to ensure compliance with the relevant safety requirements.

The Government and District Fire Safety Committees (DFSCs) will continue their joint efforts to enhance the community's awareness of fire safety. DFSCs play an important role in enhancing community involvement and public awareness of fire safety. Additionally, roving exhibitions on fire safety will be shown to the public.
 Efforts to enhance community's awareness of fire safety

The Secretary for Home Affairs, Mr David Lan stressed the need to promote a fire safety among members of the public in view of the dry weather in the coming months.  Mr Lan also suggested legislation requiring greater measures of fire safety in composite buildings with the Fire Services Department issuing advisory letters and stepping up inspections.

Fire measures and the safety of old buildings were the concern of others such as the Hon Kennedy Wong Ying- ho whose inquiry regarding the dry season and the promotion of legislative fire measures prompted a response from Mr Peter Lai in the Privisional Legislative Council.  In response Mr Lai said that the Government will introduce legislation to improve the fire safety of old commercial buildings.

According to the Secretary for Security, Mrs Regina Ip, the Government is studying how to improve the fire safety standards of all composite buildings.  Not only has the Fire Services Department expanded along with roving exhibitions promoting fire safety but other legislation "stepping up enforcement actions to ensure that property owners or management bodies would upkeep and improve the fire service structures and installations of their buildings," Mrs Ip said.
