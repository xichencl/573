Due to violent crimes in Hong Kong, rewards, ranging from $50,000 to $500,000, are given to an individual, or apportioned amongst individuals, leading to the arrest and satisfactory prosecution of the culprit(s). Information should be given to any police officer, police station, or a police hotline. 
 In an attempt to eliminate violent crime, Hong Kong Police are offering large rewards for information about them.

The types of crimes for which the rewards are being offered are murder, homicide, rape, arson and robbery.  The award money amount range from $50 thousand to $500 thousand.



 In an effort to gain further information on criminal cases, the Hong Kong police department has issued public appeals. Information supplied by an individual that leads to prosecution will be rewarded, ranging from $50,000 - $500,000. The appeals include the type of criminal act, details about the act, and a description of the suspect(s).
