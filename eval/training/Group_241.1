The Secretary for Home Affairs, Mr David Lan stressed the need to promote a fire safety among members of the public in view of the dry weather in the coming months.  Mr Lan also suggested legislation requiring greater measures of fire safety in composite buildings with the Fire Services Department issuing advisory letters and stepping up inspections.

According to the Secretary for Security, Mrs Regina Ip, the Government is studying how to improve the fire safety standards of all composite buildings.  Legislation should improve the administrative framework to uprage fire facilities in old buildings and also create roving exhibitions promoting fire safety.
