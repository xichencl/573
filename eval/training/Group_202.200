Measures regarding evironmental protection and air pollution.

Following an observed and marked rise in air pollution levels in Hong Kong last winter, several notably inquiries were made regarding the assesment and plan of action of the Government.  Primary among the indications of higher levels of air pollution was the Air Pollution Indexes by the Environmental Protection Department and recorded by their  general and roadside monitoring stations dispersed across various districts of the territory.  On Decmeber 30 of last year, and the several days following, the Air Pollution Indexes reached record levels.

The inquiries of distinguished individuals such as the Hon. Lui Ming-wah, the Hon. Leung Yiu-chung, the Hon. David Li, and the Hon. Mrs. Sophie Leung prompted replies from the Secretary for the Environment and Food and the Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands.  These inquiries primarily focused on the actions the Government will take in the future to alleviate the air pollution problem.  Another focus of the questioning was an obvious source of the problem; vehicle emissions.

In reply to these inquiries, the Legislative Council cited the tightening of emission standards and the use of alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, emphasizing their commitment to the common goal.
 Several dialogues between the Legislative Council and various secretaries including Secretary for Planning, Environment and Lands, Secretary for the Environment and Food, Secretary for Health and Welfare; as well as statements made to the press by the Government Land Trasport Agency (GLTA) seek to promote the image of a government that considers environmental protection a top priority.

According to the various Secretaries, there are a wide range of on-going and new measures aimed at reducing the amount of air-pollution caused by automobiles. Several of these measures include: switching taxi and bus service from diesel machines to less-polluting Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) vehicles; providing education and incentives for drivers and government fleet managers to raise their environmental protection awareness and maintain adequate maitenence of their vehicles; reducing the polluting content of some fuels, such as the benzene in petrol; increasing ease and availability of public transportation, and promoting pedestrianisation in order to reduce the number of automobiles; implementing more stringent and practical vehicle emmision standards, including Euro III emission standards for all new diesel vehicles, as well as providing free installation of catalytic converters capable of reducing particulates emmissions in pre-Euro standard medium and heavy diesel vehicles by up to 50%.

 The Hong Kong government is taking several measures to improve air quality in the region.  Among the areas of concern are helping vehicles switch to more efficient fuels, monitoring levels of industrial pollution, and providing civic education on pollution problems.

The government is planning to offer grants to owners of taxis and light buses to switch to more efficient LPG fuel. For light diesel vehicles, and in the short term for taxis and light buses, particulate traps to reduce emissions will be installed free of charge.  As for buses and more heavy diesel vehicles, the government plans to arrange free installation of catalytic converters. Diesel vehicles releasing excessive smoke will be monitored.

For industrial sources of emission, natural gas has been introduced for power generation in Hong Kong, and coal plants have been required to reduce harmful emissions.  The government has also introuduced licensing control on major industrial sources of pollution.

Education is being provided to vehicle service professionals on measures to reduce emsissions.  The Environmental Protection Department also holds seminars and exhibitions to educate the public on air pollution.  Through the measures it is taking and plans to take, the government hopes to improve air quality in Hong Kong.
