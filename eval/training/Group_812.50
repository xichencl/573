For the year 2000-2001 The Mandatory Provident Fund's mission according to chairman Charles Lee Yeh-kwong was to "Ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's work force."

Each year, the MPFA accepts applications for approval of MPF corporate trustees from insurance companies and banks and applications for MPF exemption from Occupational Retirement Schemes.



  The Management Board of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority endorsed at its meeting the MPFA Corporate Plan 2000-2001 and proposed amendments to the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Regulation. Programmes and activities outlined in the MPFA Corporate Plan were constructed with the mission and target of the MPFA in mind.

 The mission of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) is to ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's workforce. They asked that all employers register in the system, unless exempted for existing retirement schemes under the Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance. After implementation, the MPFA will act as lead regulator and co-ordinator.
