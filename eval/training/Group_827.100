Good health and hygiene is being promoted through program participation and rewards.

The Provisional Urban Council (PUC) Ambassadors of Hygiene is a title awarded annually to 24 students who present exceptional written projects on health.  The competition, is divided into three categories. 8 winners are selected from each group. The winners are named at an award ceremony.  Then the ambassadors go to Japan to discuss public health with Japanese officials.

Other health-related programs include the "Know More about Environmental Hygiene Facilities cum Life skill Training Camp."  Applications must be submitted, but admission is free.  At this camp children learn about environmental hygiene facilities.

  In Hong Kong, secondary Two to Four students studying in schools in the New Territories and outlying islands, who intend to join the "Know More about Environmental Hygiene Facilities cum Lifeskill Training Camp", were reminded to submit their applications before the deadline for entry. Organised by the Provisional Regional Council in association with the Education Department, the activity aimed to encourage students to make good use of their environmental hygiene facilities and services, and then disseminate the message to their schoolmates, friends and family members. Twenty-four entrants were later appointed Provisional Urban Council Ambassadors at a flag presentation ceremony.


 The Provisional Regional Council (Pro RC) and Provisional Urban Council (PUC) both presented competitions for students to demonstrate and gain knowledge about public health and environmental hygiene, and then to disseminate their newfound knowledge in their communities. Secondary students have a chance to gain more environmental hygiene knowledge through visits to a number of the Pro RC's hygiene facilities and participation in a lifeskill training camp. The winners of the PUC Ambassador of Hygiene Competition will go to Japan to gain an insight into Japan's hygiene services and facilities, and share with Japanese students on their views in promoting health education in schools.
