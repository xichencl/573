Hong Kong museums are proud to feature a variety of new exhibits.  The Hong Kong Museum of Art, the Hong Kong Science Museum, and the Hong Kong Museum of History all have new displays.

The Museum of Art will be showing Italian Baroque pieces donated by the National Gallery of Art in Rome.  Works from the twentieth century "Cobra" movement and French Impressionist and Surrealist paintings will also be on display.

"Rise of Modern China" is a new Chinese history exhibit at the Museum of History.
 The Hong Kong Science Museum will feature a large-scale exhibition entitled "Chinese Dinosaur Fossils" as part of an on-going effort in popularizing science and its related activities. 

The Hong Kong Museum of Art's exhibitions showcase artists from Europe. These include the Fluxus, New Realism, and contemporary French artists of the 1960s and 1970s; Italian masters of the Renaissance and Baroque periods; as well as the "Cobra," a blending of European artists from 1948 to 1951.

The Hong Kong Museum of History's "Rise of Modern China" exhibition will feature over 400 significant historical objects of China's endeavours in the past century towards strength and prosperity.

 Many art, science, and history exhibitions are on display in Hong Kong. The Museum of Art will present exhibitions on baroque Italian paintings, contemporary French art from Nice, Japanese art, the Cobra Movement, new Chinese art from the United States and Buddhist sculptures from the Mainland, and a Masterpieces exhibition.  "This programme of international exhibitions will contribute to the continued development of Hong Kong as the cultural hub of Asia," said the Secretary for Home Affairs.
