Customs officers of the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau are busy combating piracy activities and preserving the good image of Hong Kong.
Customs conducts intensive investigations on the retail front and protecting control points at the borders of Hong Kong from smugglers.
Pirated optical discs are often VCDs, CD-Roms, music CDs, and MCDs, and sometimes the VCDs are obscene. Obscene and indecent articles carry their own punishments.
They smash notorious shops selling pirated optical discs in shopping arcades and seize paraphernalia. This move often leads to the cessation of business.
They also smash storage centers of pirated optical discs and neutralize unliscensed optical disc workshops.



 The Hong Kong government is continuing to crack down on the production of pirated optical discs. 

During anti-piracy raids, Customs officers, acting on intelligence information, smash the production site and detain the individuals responsible.  Among the items seized have been video CDs, music CDs, game discs, CD-Roms, Japanese TV dramas, and obscene materials.  Pirated optical discs have also been seized at the airport and seaports.  These discs are smuggled into Hong Kong from Malaysia, Singapore, and Macau. 

The public are reminded that the Copyright Ordinance gives a heavy penalty to anyone found importing or selling pirated items.
