Customs Commissioner, Mr.John Tsang Chun-wah assured that Customs is fully committed to intellectual property rights (IPR) protection and will continue to maintain Hong Kong as a pirate-free zone.  There are approximately 300 officers in the Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau and a 185-member Special Task Force that helps fight the street war.

In December 1997, a license requirement for the import and export of optical disc manufacturing equipment was issued. In spite of this, Hong Kong remained on the "Watch List" of the United States Trade Representative's _Special 301 Report_ on the protection of IPR.

Into 1999, the department had neutralized 19 illegal factories manufacturing pirated optical discs and impounded 75 production lines.  The previous year, it seized more than 40 million discs, an increase of 770% over 1997.

At the World Intellectual Property Organization Asian Regional Symposium approximately 150 delegates focused on "Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights under the TRIPS Agreement".  In his keynote speech, Mr. Chau Tak Hay said the three new laws, the Copyright Ordinance, the Registered Design Ordinance and the Patents Ordinance, which were enacted last year meet the high standards set down in the trade-related aspects of the Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement of the World Trade Organization.


 Spurred by the World Trade Organization, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented measures to fight copyright piracy. Intellectual property rights protection is an essential element in the development of trade, investment and technology transfer, and copyright infringement undermines economic viability. HKSAR's approach to combatting the problem involves legislation, enforcement, education and cooperation with intellectual property rights owners. Two important pieces of legislation have been passed: the Copyright Ordinance and the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance, both of which have helped to strengthen Customs' capabilities in anti-pirating. The Copyright Ordinance raised penalties for copyright piracy and granted Customs greater ability to conduct raids at the retail level, resulting in seizures of millions of pirated discs. The Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance requires that all optical disc manufacturers be licensed for import and export by Customs and that all optical discs made in HKSAR carry a source code. The Government has also raised public awareness, helping citizens understand the importance of intellectual property rights and the impact of piracy. Through all of these efforts, Hong Kong's laws concerning intellectual property rights are regarded as among the world's highest standard, and piracy has been shrinking rapidly.
 The Hong Kong government remains committed to the protection of intellectual property rights.  Due to the actions of the Customs department, optical disc piracy has been on the decline.  Certain reports, however, indicate that piracy remains a problem in Hong Kong.

Customs' ability to enforce against piracy was strengthened under the Copyright Ordinance of June 1997.  Courts have begun to give heavier sentences for piracy, as well.  The Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance requires all manufacturers of optical discs to be licensed by Customs.  In September 1999, the Commissioner of Customs and Excise announced that piracy was under control, as the sale of pirated compact discs in shopping areas had been sharply decreasing.  This was in part due to a change in enforcement strategies, in which Customs established a task force to combat piracy at the street level, while also targeting piracy at the manufacturing and storage levels.  

As of 1998, Hong Kong was still listed on the Watch List in the United States Trade Representative's Special 301 Report on intellectual property rights.  The Hong Kong government felt that the statements of the report regarding Hong Kong were unfair, given the effort and progress that the government has made in halting piracy.
