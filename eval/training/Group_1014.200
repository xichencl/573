 During certain times of the year Hong Kong police conduct traffic operations. The following are typical examples of these operations.
 Eastern District Police officers issued a total of 126 fixed penalty tickets and 33 summonses against road users violating traffic regulations during an operation conducted between 8 am and 4 pm on May 26, 1999. Twenty-six officers from Eastern District Headquarters, North Point Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Chai Wan Division and Eastern District Traffic Team were deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district. A total of 114 tickets were issued for illegal parking and 12 for other traffic offences. Thirty-one jaywalkers were summonsed. Thirty-eight pedestrians and 77 drivers were cautioned for committing minor traffic offences during the eight-hour operation.

 In another operation the Eastern District Police offers issued a total of 150 fixed penalty tickets and 39 summonses against road users violating traffic regulatoins. Twenty-four officers were deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district. A total of 138 tickets were issued against illegal parking and 12 for other traffic offences. Thirty-nine jaywalkers were summonsed. Eight pedestrians and 83 drivers were cautioned for committing minor traffic offences during the eight-hour operation.

 In an effort to curb traffic offenses, the Eastern District Police regularly conduct Eastern Traffic Days. During a period from 8 am to 4 pm on a weekday, usually a Wednesday, Thursday, or a Friday, police officers from Eastern District Headquarters, North Point Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Chai Wan Division and Eastern District Traffic Team are deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district. They issue fixed penalty tickets for illegal parking and other traffic offenses, and dispense summonses for jay-walkers. They also cautioned many other pedestrians and drivers for minor traffic offenses. From the police reports, 29 officers were deployed for Traffic Day in 1998, with a total of 144 fixed penalty tickets and 64 summonses issued, and an additional 53 pedestrians and 45 drivers cautioned. 1999 appeared to be the most successful; the police conducted 6 Traffic Days. A total of 784 fixed penalty tickets and 272 summonses were issued, and an additional 215 pedestrians and 592 drivers cautioned. In 2000, there were 3 Traffic Days, with only 384 fixed penalty tickets and 126 summonses issued, and an additional 82 pedestrians and 274 drivers cautioned. Most of the fixed penalty tickets were for illegal parking.
 If police officers got paid by the ticket, then I'm sure that Eastern Traffic Day is their favorite day of the year.  On this day between 8 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon, police are out in large numbers strictly enforcing traffic laws that often go ignored.  Most often, the police patrol areas that are well-known for having major traffic problems.  

Officers from Eastern District Headquarters, North Point Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Chai Wan Division and Eastern District Traffic Team were deployed to enforce traffic regulations in traffic black spots in the district.  Usually 20-30 officers are deployed to carry-out the operation.
