 British abdication of control of Hong Kong to China presents a rather peculiar situation. Essentially there now exists one country but two legal and cultural systems. In efforts to smooth the transition and talk about rendition there have been numerous dialogues between the two. 
 For instance, the Secretary for Security, Mrs. Regina Ip, has held useful and positive discussions with the Mainland authorities on rendition during her stay in Beijing. The purpose of the visit was to hold exploratory discussions with the Mainland authorities on rendition and to pay courtesy calls on the relevant ministries and state agencies.
