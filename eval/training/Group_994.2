The development of electronic commerce is necessary for Hong Kong's success in the future.  To help this new technology develop, the government is taking the lead in ensuring that the public accepts electronic commerce as a valid way to make transactions.

The Hongkong Post plans to establish a public key infrastructure, so that businesses can identify the parties in an electronic transaction.  The government also plans to give digital signatures used for electronic transactions the same legal status as signatures on paper. 

In 1999, the number of internet users in Hong Kong, as well as the number of users making online purchases, increased sharply.
