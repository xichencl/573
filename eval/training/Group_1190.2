The first fatal case of Enterovirus 71 was reported in Hong Kong since a surveillance system on hand-foot-mouth disease was set up in the territory.  This brings the total number of EV-71 cases in Hong Kong this year to six.

While the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority would closely monitored the situation, a spokesman reminded the public to maintain good personal hygiene.  So long as the public adheres to covering mouth when you cough or sneeze, washing hands after using toilets, changing diapers and before taking meals, the chance of a major outbreak in Hong Kong could be prevented.
