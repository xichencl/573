The mission of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) is to ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's workforce. From 1998-2000, the MPFA worked to implement the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (MPF) System in December of 2000. They asked that all employers register for an MPF scheme, unless exempted under MPF requirements of existing retirement schemes under the Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance (ORSO). After implementation, the MPFA will act as the registration authority, lead regulator and co-ordinator, and rely on several other government monetary agencies for the licensing and supervision of MPF intermediaries.
