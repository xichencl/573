 Resale restriction period for Home Ownership Scheme (HOS)/Private Sector Participation Scheme flats was shortened to enhance the attractiveness of HOS and help promote mobility of flats in the open market and the secondary HOS market. It is intended that through activities in the secondary HOS market, more rental flats can be recovered for allocation to needy families. The approval to relax the existing resale restrictions was given in February 1999, by the Housing Authority's Home Ownership Committee (HOC). 
 The relaxation is also intended to tie in with  arrangements under the Tenants Purchase Scheme by bringing in a uniformed and consistent approach in resale restrictions for the two schemes. Owners can sell their flats in the open market, subject to payment of a premium proportionate to the original discount, after five years from first assignment. This will replace the existing 10-year resale restriction rule. A spokesman for the Authority said: "The Authority will not buy back flats after the five-year restriction period since these flats can be sold in the open market." Besides, HOS flats could be put on sale in the HOS secondary market a year earlier following the relaxation that allows owners to sell their flats to sitting public rental housing tenants.



 The Housing Authority's Home Ownership Committee (HOC) has relaxed many restrictions on flat purchase and rental. One is that the resale restriction period for Home Ownership Scheme (HOS)/Private Sector Participation Scheme flats will be shortened to enhance the attractiveness of HOS and help promote mobility of flats, both in the open market and the secondary HOS market, and will also allow more rental flats to be recovered for allocation to needy families. Owners can sell their flats in the open market, subject to payment of a premium proportionate to the original discount, after five years from first assignment, which will replace the existing 10-year resale restriction rule. Others options include: owners may sell their flats, between two to five years of first assignment, to sitting public rental housing tenants and Waiting List applicants at a negotiated price without the payment of premium; and these HOS owners is to apply to sell their flats back to the Authority at assessed market value less the original discount. The HOC is also opening up HOS flat availability to single persons, for small flats; this was later relaxed further to allow singles to purchase larger flats in buildings where all families have made their selections.

 The Housing Authority (HA) has taken several steps to make renting and buying homes easier for all people.

The Chief Executive in Council approved amended resale restrictions for flats sold under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) and Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS) to bring them in line with those approved for Tenants Purchase Scheme (TPS) flats.  To provide greater flexibility to Home Ownership Scheme flat owners, the ten-year resale restriction period was shortened to five years with effect from 1st June, 1999. After the relaxation of resale restriction period of HOS/PSPS flats, the number of applications for premium assessment for HOS flats before putting up for sale in the open market increased sharply.

The accessibility of single persons to home ownership was also enhanced.  To cater to the demands of single people for larger flats, the Housing Authority decided to allow singleton applicants to purchase subsidised home ownership flats irrespective of the flat size when all family households have made their flat selections.  Single persons are allowed to apply starting from the next phase of the HOS/HPLS.

The HA also took measures to ensure early recovery of public rental housing flats under various home ownership schemes.
