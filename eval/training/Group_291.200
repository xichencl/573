For each government election, the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) held registration drives that increased registered voters and assured accurate voter registration information. The drive included door-to-door visits by volunteers to assist in registering every eligible voter. A large percentage of new voters are young people aged between 18 and 25. Once the registers have been compiled, it is important for individuals to check their registration particulars and to make corrections or lodge appeals regarding any entry. Information such as a change in address must be correct in order for people to be able to vote in their geographical and functional constituencies. Omission lists are also compiled, for electors who had passed away or were no longer living at their registered address. Both the provisional and final registers of electors are printed and displayed in key locations such as the REO and District Offices for public inspection. Cases of objections and claims will be referred to the Revising Officers for determination. A registered elector may call the REO hotline or make enquiries via fax to check his own registration particulars. The REO also send out postcards, reminding people to both check their voter information and to go vote on the election day.
 The first step to voting in Hong Kong is registration to do so.  Home Affairs Department staff have visited 1.8 million families or 90 per cent of all the households in Hong Kong to help eligible electors fill out registration forms and to verify and update the records of registered electors on the electoral roll.  Each year the Registration and electoral Office receives thousands of new application forms for registration and to report changes of residential address.

Later, the names and home addresses of the more than 3 million electors are published for public inspection.  Omissions lists containing the names and residential addresses of electors who have died or are no longer eligible to be included in the register will also made public.  This is done so their registered electors can verify that all of their information has been recorded correctly.  Electors may raise objections or make claims regarding any discrepancies found on the register or the omissions list by submitting a notice to the REO in person.  Cases of objections are referred to one of several Revising Officers for hearing.

Only electors whose name appears on the final list are eligible to vote in the Legislative Council election.



  Voting in Hong Kong is a many staged process that consists of categorizing electors in specific boundaries, registering electors, and, broadly speaking, urging people to vote. In charge of these activities is the REO (Registration and Electoral Office). 
 For example, in preparation for a 60-member Legislative Council that will be made up of 20 seats to be returned from five geographical constituencies through direct elections, 30 seats from 28 functional constituencies and 10 seats from the 800-member Election Committee, which will be formed through subsector elections in early April 1998, the REO has received 305,000 application forms for voter registration and report of change of residential address of registered electors since a voter registration drive started on January 17, 2000. An initial assessment finds that more than half of the forms are from residents applying for registration for the first time and nearly 40 per cent of the new electors are young people aged between 18 and 25. Home Affairs Department staff have visited 1.8 million families or 90 per cent of all the households in Hong Kong to help eligible electors fill out registration forms and to verify and update the records of registered electors on the electoral roll.
