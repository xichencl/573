The first fatal case of Enterovirus-71 since the Department of Health introduced a surveillance system to monitor Hand-Foot-Mouth disease was announced, with confirmed cases at six.

So long as the community adhered to DH's health advice and maintained good personal hygiene, the chance of a major outbreak in Hong Kong could be prevented.
  In mid-June 1998 the Hong Kong goverment set up a sentinel surveillance system to monitor hand-food-mouth disease, which is one of the manifestations of enterovirus disease. The disease is usually self-limiting but severe forms affecting the brain and the heart can occur. In 1998, there were 60 confirmed cases of EV-71.


 The Department of Health has introduced a surveillance system to monitor hand-foot-mouth diesease, a manifestation of Enterovirus 71.  The surveillance system had success in stopping the spread of Enterovirus 71, with the first fatal case of hand-foot-mouth disease occurring eleven months later.  The government urges citizens to practice good hygiene to prevent the disease.
