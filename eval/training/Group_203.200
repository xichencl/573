The Hong Kong government has been working to improve care services for the elderly.  After concerns over the performance of homes for the elderly, the government says that it has made improvement in delivering services to the elderly population.

Many citizens were concerned about the time that people have spent on waiting lists to enter government-subsidized care homes.  The government responded that it would implement a system by which only those elderly in genuine need of residential care would be eligible to apply, so that waiting lists would be shortened.  The Social Welfare Department also planned to give additional resources to  homes, so that the elderly would not need to be transferred between homes offering different levels of care.  Also, the government pledged to allocate additional funds to home and community services for the elderly, and engage the private sector to reduce the public burden.

In the fall of 1999, the government announced it had shortened the waiting time for care homes and commissioned additional homes.  It also announced that it would create 14,000 new care homes in nine years.  The government also highlighted the social and educational programs offered to the elderly to help older people live meaningful lives.



 Concerns have surfaced regarding long waiting periods for the applicants of subvented residential care homes for the elderly such as hostels, homes for the aged, care and attention homes, and nursing homes.  The government assures the council that waiting time varies for different applicants based on their health conditions and specific preferences. Health and family status also affect waiting time. As of March 2000, waiting time ranges from about 5 to 22 months, depending on a number of factors. However, for applicants in urgent need, immediate placement can be arranged, forgoing normal waiting procedure. There is some belief that the application process is too complicated and some elderly people do not understand that as they choose more preferences their wait lengthens, and the government is taking measures to fix this. Regarding occupancy rates, the government reports that in April 1999 rates exceeded 96%. Satisfaction levels regarding service quality are high among family members of elderly people admitted into residential care homes for the elderly. The government will continue to discuss ways to improve residential care and welfare services for the elderly. The Elderly Commission will be conducting a study on the quality of life of the elderly in Hong Kong.
 Concern over the residential care of elderly population.

The Elderly Commission met several times this month to discuss a wide range of issues concerning the residential care of the elderly.  One of the primary issues of concern is the consideration of subsidising more private residential care facilities, increasing the number of available places and therefore shortening waiting time.

The inquiries of several distinguished individuals such as the Hon. Leung Yiu-chung, the Hon. Bernard Chan, the Hon. Lau Kong-wah, and the Hon. Law Chi-kwong prompted a response from the Secretary for Health and Welfare in the Legislative Council.  First among these voiced concerns are the long waiting lists for spots in elderly care facilities.  The commonly suggested solutions require the provision of more housing facilities or the adoption of new criteria for determining the eligibility and priority of elderly persons for allocation of places in subvented residential care homes.

In response to these inquiries, the Secretary for Health and Welfare cited past effort and continued commitment.  While the Government pledged, in the Policy Address last year, to allocate substantial resources to increase the supply of residential care places, the Social Welfare Department will introduce a pilot project protecting the future system.
