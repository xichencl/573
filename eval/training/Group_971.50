 The Chineese government, specifically the Customs Drug Investigation Bureau and the Narcotics Bureau, have been engaged in various efforts to stem the heroin trade. There were a number of arrests of individuals, neutralisation of various centrse for drug manufacturing, and prevention of influx of drugs into the country.



 Customs Agents have made several heroin seizures and arrested several people charged with illegal drug trafficking.

The ages of the suspect were all between 20 and 50 years.  The amount of heroin found during each seizure was as small as 250 grams but not larger than 10 kilograms.


 The Customs Drug Investigation Bureau and Narcotics Bureau both seek to erdicate narcotics trafficking, in particular the smuggling, manufacture, and distribution of heroin. Their success can be seen in an increase of the amount of heroin seized and drug manufacturing centres smashed, without an increase in drug demand.
