The mission of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) is to ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's workforce. From 1998-2000, the MPFA worked to implement the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes (MPF) System in December of 2000. They asked that all employers register for an MPF scheme, unless exempted under MPF requirements of existing retirement schemes under the Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance (ORSO). After implementation, the MPFA will act as the registration authority, lead regulator and co-ordinator, and rely on several other government monetary agencies for the licensing and supervision of MPF intermediaries. 
 The Management Board of the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority endorsed at its meeting the MPFA Corporate Plan 2000-2001 and proposed amendments to the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Regulation. Programmes and activities outlined in the MPFA Corporate Plan were constructed with the mission and target of the MPFA in mind. "Our mission is to ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's workforce and our target is to implement the MPF System in December. Everybody in the MPFA is devoted to work towards this mission and target," said  Charles Lee Yeh-kwong. The commencement date for MPF contributions should remain unchanged.

 For the year 2000-2001 The Mandatory Provident Fund's mission according to chairman Charles Lee Yeh-kwong was to "Ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's work force."

In a meeting a couple of years earlier, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) endorsed a set of  guidelines to help service providers in complying with the MPF legislation. 

Each year, the MPFA accepts applications.

In 2000 the MPFA decided to set December 1 as the date for commencing MPF contributions.  The timetable allowed 11 months for employers to enroll their staff into MPF schemes before the commencement of contributions in December 2000.
