As a result of tendering out the ferry services, the current franchise by the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) will terminate on March 31, 1999, and the outlying island, new town and inner harbour ferry services will be operated by five separate ferry operators.

 There have been several changes in public transportation, specifically with regards to ferries.

The Transportation Department in late 1998, invited operators to bid for HYF and other routes. Many changes in management resulted.

There were also fare increases that began as of April 2000, a year after the new licenses were issued. 
  Hong Kong ferries provide an essential link to the outlying islands where land transport alternatives are not available. In March 1999, ferry services changed from HongKong and Yaumati Ferry to New World First Ferry Services. To facilitate a smooth transition, the Transport Department activated a special Operation Coordination Centre.
