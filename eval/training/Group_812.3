For the year 2000-2001 The Mandatory Provident Fund's mission according to chairman Charles Lee Yeh-kwong was to "Ensure the provision of retirement protection for Hong Kong's work force."

In a meeting a couple of years earlier, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA) endorsed a set of  guidelines to help service providers in complying with the MPF legislation. 

Each year, the MPFA accepts applications.

In 2000 the MPFA decided to set December 1 as the date for commencing MPF contributions.  The timetable allowed 11 months for employers to enroll their staff into MPF schemes before the commencement of contributions in December 2000.
