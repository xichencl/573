While no cases of the severe form of Enterovirus 71 had been confirmed since the Department of Health introduced a surveillance system in mid-June to monitor Hand-Foot-Mouth disease which is a manifestation of EV-71, laboratory results confirmed that the suspected fatal case of Enterovirus-71 announced by the Department of Health had EV-71 infection.  A spokesman for the Department said that the case involved a two-year-old boy who died on May 14.  This was the first fatal case reported in Hong Kong since a surveillance system on hand-foot-mouth disease was set up in the territory in June last year. This brings the total number of EV-71 cases in Hong Kong this year to six cases.

While the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority would closely monitored the situation, a spokesman reminded the public to maintain good personal hygiene such as covering mouth when you cough or sneeze, washing hands after using toilets, changing diapers and before taking meals.

A spokeman for an Interdepartmental Working Group on Enterovirus 71 Infections stressed that so long as the community adhered to DH's health advice and maintained good personal hygiene, the chance of a major outbreak in Hong Kong could be prevented.
 The Department of Health has introduced a surveillance system to monitor hand-foot-mouth diesease, a manifestation of Enterovirus 71.  In order to prevent the spread of this virus, the government of Hong Kong urges citizens to practice good hygiene.

The surveillance system had success in stopping the spread of Enterovirus 71, with the first fatal case of hand-foot-mouth disease occurring eleven months later.  Other cases of Enterovirus 71 made full recovery.  The victim of the fatal case, a two year-old boy, had a strain of the virus previously seen in Malaysia and Taiwan.  An Interdepartmental Working Group has also been formed to coordinate measures for the prevention and control of Enterovirus 71.  The working group inlcudes members of the Health and Welfare Bureau, the Department of Health, the Hospital Authority, the Education Department, and others.  The group decided to increase education on the disease at nurseries and kindergartens, since children under five are more vulnerable to it.

To prevent the spread of Enterovirus 71, the public are advised to wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet or handling diapers.  In addition, good air circulation should be maintained, and children suffering from the virus should stay at home until the illness is over.



  The Hong Kong Department of Health (DH) called upon members of the public to maintain personal hygiene to prevent enterovirus infection before the summer of 1999. The appeal was made by DH's Consultant, Community Medicine, Dr Mak Kwok-hang following report of a suspected fatal case of Enterovirus-71 (EV-71) infection involving a two-year-old boy who was admitted to hospital on May 14 and passed away subsequently. Initial laboratory results indicated that the boy had EV-71 infection.

 Dr Mak pointed out that EV-71 is a virus that occurs worldwide and asymtomatic infections are common.
There is a seasonal trend with most cases occurring in the  summer months. According to international experience, EV-71 infection is not an uncommon disease in children.
Affected patients will develop fever, mouth ulcers and rash on the limbs. The disease is usually self-limiting and complete recovery is the rule. However, severe forms of EV-71 infection affecting the brain and the heart can occur but are rare.

 In mid-June 1998 the government set up a sentinel surveillance system to monitor hand-food-mouth disease, which is one of the manifestations of enterovirus disease. In 1998, there were 60 confirmed cases of EV-71, five of whom had neurological complications.
