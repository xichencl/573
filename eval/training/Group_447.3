 Resale restriction period for Home Ownership Scheme (HOS)/Private Sector Participation Scheme flats was shortened to enhance the attractiveness of HOS and help promote mobility of flats in the open market and the secondary HOS market. It is intended that through activities in the secondary HOS market, more rental flats can be recovered for allocation to needy families. Approval to relax the resale restrictions was made in February 1999, by the Housing Authority's Home Ownership Committee (HOC). The relaxation is also intended to coincide with arrangements under the Tenants Purchase Scheme by bringing in a uniformed, consistent approach in resale restrictions for the schemes.
