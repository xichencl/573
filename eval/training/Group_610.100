The judgments of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) delivered on 29 January 1999 have extended the eligibility for the right of abode (ROA) of persons born in the Mainland of Hong Kong permanent residents beyond that previously provided for in the Immigration Ordinance. In its judgments, the CFA decided that certain provisions in two previous ROA Ordinances were inconsistent with the Basic Law. To reprehend the situation, a motion has been made to appeal to the NPCSC for an interpretation of Basic Law and to find a resolution.
 The Government of Hong Kong was to appeal the decision of the Court of First Instance.  This decision extended right of abode (ROA) to persons of Chinese nationality born outside of Hong Kong, who at the date of their birth had parents neither of whom were permanent residents and one of whom subsequently acquired that status.  This decision was finalized on by the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  The CFA also ruled that these persons could enter Hong Kong for settlement without approval from Mainland authorities.

Other important court decisions include Immigration (Amendment)(No.5) Bill 1997.




  The Executive Council of Hong Kong endorsed the Immigration Bill 1997 to the Provisional Legislative Council. The Bill provides that children who claim the right to abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must produce proof of their right by way of a Certificate of Entitlement. The COE is in response to the reunification of Hong Kong and China. Due to a law already in place many mainland children have a right they did not formerly possess. If all these children arrived in Hong Kong at once, the impact on the social support services would be difficult to bear.
