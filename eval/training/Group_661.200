In light of a clear need for educational reform, the Chief Executive has asked the Education Commission (EC) to begin a thorough review of the structure of pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary education, addressing the age at which students should begin each stage of education, the duration and interface of various stages, the curriculum and methods of assessment. This review was conducted in stages, the focus of the first stage being on the aims of education for Hong Kong in the 21st Century. The EC performed a public consultation exercise, which revealed that in general the community wants educational reform. The present system is considered too examination-oriented, with too much emphasis on rote-learning, and can no longer meet the needs of Hong Kong. In the second stage, th EC conducted a examination of the existing academic structure. It also worked towards the establishment of a General Teaching Council, in order to raise teacher standards. The final stage is to make recommendations and lay a developmental foundation. In response to the EC's efforts, the Government has set aside a total of $800 million in the 2000-01 budget to enable some of the more urgent recommendations to make an early start.

  EC was asked by the Chief Executive in his first Policy Address to undertake a thorough review of the education system in Hong Kong to see how it should develop in the 21st century. 
 The Chairman of the Education Commission (EC), the Hon Antony Leung, announced the outcome of the consultation exercise on the aims of education as the first stage of the review of academic system in Hong Kong. Mr Leung explained that the objectives of the consultation exercise were to seek the views of the public on the aims of education and to touch off a territory-wide discussion to identify a consensual orientation for education development. 
 "It can be discerned from the public views that in general, the community want educational reform.
The present system is considered too examination-oriented, with too much emphasis on rote-learning.
It can no longer meet the needs of Hong Kong.
The public also generally agree with the aims of education as stated, although some want the aims to be more specific and measurable, rather than broad and idealistic. Many parents and students say that too much homework are making the students lose interest in learning. They also want the quality of teaching... improved," he said.



 Over the past few years, the Hong Kong Education Commission (EC) has taken several steps at reforming the system of education in the country. 

The EC held several meetings at which they discussed how they would go about performing a review of the country's academic structure.  They vowed to take a fresh look at the goals of education and the aims of different education stages, from pre-primary to tertiary education in the light of existing and future needs of the community.  These meetings were inspired by similar gatherings of the Board of Education and the university Grants Committee.  They were also partially a response to media enquiries concerning a proposal for the heads of tertiary institutions to change the duration of undergraduate programs to four years, the EC began a review of the academic structure.  

In addition to the review meetings, the EC also formed two subgroups to examine issues related to pre-primary and special education.

In Hong Kong, education accounts for 21% of government spending.  For the 2000-2001 Budget, the government set aside $800 million.  According to EC Chairman Mr. Anthony Leung, this was to enable some of the more urgent reform recommendations of the EC to be put into place.
