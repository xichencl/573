The Provisional Urban Council recently announced several free carnivals open to the public.  Perhaps the most spectacular event occured when thousands gathered to share the festive joy in a lantern carnival.

Others include a Sports and Games Carnival, a Wushu Carnival, a Dance Carnival, and more in a continuing series of lantern carnivals.
 The Provisional Regional Council will be holding several carnivals.  These carnivals will celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day.

At the 1999 Mid-Autumn Lantern Carnival, song and dance performances will be featured, along with lantern crafting activities. The Wushu Carnival, Dance Carnival, and Sports and Games Carnival will be held to celebrate National Day.
 There are several latern festivals and dance carnivals for Mid-Autumn and National Day, all issued on behalf of the Provisional Regional Council (Pro RC).

The carnivals are specially organized to provide residents of the New Territories with different entertainment programmes as well as to enhance their knowledge of the festive traditions.
