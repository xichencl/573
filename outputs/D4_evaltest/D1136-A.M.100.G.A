The Yangtze River hydrology bureau attributed the drop to lower rainfall on the upper reaches and serious drought along the river.
The lake's water level has been falling continuously since last July as it supplies water to the drought-stricken Yangtze River.
The company said the floodgates could maintain the water level at 144 meters.
Experts blamed the low water level of the 330,000-hectare lake for the decrease.
In Anqing, the water is only four meters deep, and will continue to drop as the drought continues, Zhou said.
The number of migratory birds in Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, has dropped by 40 percent.
