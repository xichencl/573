People huddled in dressing rooms and barricaded themselves in offices as 19-year-old Robert A. Hawkins sprayed the floor with bullets.
The shooting "appears to be very random and without provocation," Warren said late Wednesday, adding that police were still interviewing witnesses.
"We have confirmed nine people that ... died from their injuries," Negron said.
She said he phoned her at about 1 p.m. Wednesday, telling her he had left a note.
On Wednesday, the 19-year-old killed eight people and himself in a shooting rampage at an Omaha shopping mall, police said.
Police identified Hawkins' victims as six employees and two customers.
