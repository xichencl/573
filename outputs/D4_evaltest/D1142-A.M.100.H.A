Seven bombs ripped through the city of Jaipur, leaving at least 60 people dead.
"We have information that 80 people have died," Rajasthan state home minister Gulab Chand Kataria told reporters.
"Today's bombings in Jaipur have shown again the horrific destruction which terrorism brings," Miliband said in a statement.
"Obviously, it's a terrorist plot," said A.S. Gill, the police chief of Rajasthan, the state where Jaipur is located.
Another 100 people have reportedly been wounded in Tuesday's attacks.
Serial blasts rocked crowded market areas and near a Hanuman temple in the walled tourist city.
"It's a terror attack," police director general Amorjot Singh Gill said.
