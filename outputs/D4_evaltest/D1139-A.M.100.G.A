At 330 meters (1,080 feet), it's the length of an aircraft carrier, able to carry about 2 million barrels of oil.
Somali pirates have hijacked a Saudi-owned oil tanker off the Kenyan coast, the U.S. Navy said Monday.
Earlier reports had said that the 1,080-foot-long ship, Sirius Star, had been hijacked off the Kenyan coast.
On Tuesday, the super-tanker, carrying 100 million dollars of oil, was anchored off the Somali piracy hub port of Haradhere.
It was the largest ship pirates have seized, and the farthest out to sea they have successfully struck.
