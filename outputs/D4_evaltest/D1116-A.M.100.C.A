It is not immediately known if there is any Chinese students among the killed or wounded.
The first 911 call about the shootings was made to university police at 7:15 a.m.
Virginia Tech President Charles Steger said Tuesday all classes for the rest of the week at the university have been cancelled.
"There is no indication that this is an act of terrorism," FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said in a statement.
Virginia Tech also has a full-time military training program with a corps of cadets, one of the few in the country.
Virginia Tech reported a campus shooting Monday and told students to stay inside their residences and away from windows.
