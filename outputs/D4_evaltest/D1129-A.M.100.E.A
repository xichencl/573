Might higher levels of vitamin D in the blood lower the likelihood of developing this cancer?
Adequate intake of vitamin D may help prevent cancer, according to a new study.
Canada's Cancer Society on Thursday urged people to increase vitamin D intake, citing growing evidence of the supplement reducing cancer risks.
Dr. Michael Thun now says he misunderstood a reporter's question and holds no position on whether those amounts should be changed.
The study combined data from surveys of serum vitamin D levels during winter from 15 countries.
The data revealed an inverse association of serum vitamin D with risk of colorectal and breast cancer.
