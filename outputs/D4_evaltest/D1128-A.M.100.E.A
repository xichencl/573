"The lawyers threaten to withdraw their services if the situation does not change", the statement said.
Taylor goes on trial on June 4 at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Taylor is charged with overseeing a campaign of terror, murder, mutilation, rape and enslavement in neighboring Sierra Leone's 10-year civil war.
Judge Teresa Doherty made it clear, however, the trial's June 4 start date would not change.
Taylor is accused of orchestrating war crimes in Sierra Leone while he was leader of neighboring West African state Liberia.
The charges against Taylor stem from his alleged backing of Sierra Leonean rebels, who mutilated, raped and enslaved their victims.
