The collapse of Bernard L. Madoff's company came just hours before his arrest Thursday on a single securities fraud count.
A British investment fund that also acknowledged being a Madoff client criticised what it called the "systemic failure" of US regulators.
Bramdean Alternatives Limited said the accusations against Madoff raised "fundamental questions" about the American financial regulatory system.
Madoff is alleged to have lost 50 billion dollars in a giant pyramid scheme that collapsed in the global financial crisis.
Media reports have said Europe's second-largest banking consortium, Spain's Grupo Santander SA, also has extensive exposure to Madoff's funds.
Fear ran deep for investors in Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC.
