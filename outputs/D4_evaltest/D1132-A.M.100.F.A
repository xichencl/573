It was the first time the turtle species was found in Thailand in two decades, the WWF said.
"Seventeen of them were arrested on board, one skipper and another 16 workers.
The arrest of the 17 Chinese fishermen was the second swoop by marine police last month.
On March 26 they caught 19 Chinese nationals, also from Hainan, with nearly 80 turtles, most of which were also dead.
They've recently formalized a partnership with the nonprofit Grupo Ecologico Manos Unidas por Litibu A.C (Litibu Ecology Group).
The World Conservation Union lists the Hawksbill turtle as critically endangered, while the Green turtle is also endangered.
