The collision left three holes in the 146,000-ton tanker Hebbei Spirit, leading to the leak, a ministry official said.
YTN, a 24-hour cable news channel, showed footage of the black oil leaking out of the ship and into the ocean.
The ministry said the spillage might be greater than the estimated 10,000 tons.
"So far, we have no reports of damage," said Kim Jong-seok, an official at the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry.
The slick was 7.4 kilometers (4.6 miles) long and 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) wide, the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry said.
The spill released about 66,000 barrels (10.5 million liters; 2.7 million gallons), said Coast Guard officer Jung Se-hi.
