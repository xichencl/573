The accident happened on 51st Street near 2nd Avenue at about 2:20 p.m. at the construction site of a high-rise condominium.
Officials said about 250 cranes were in operation in the five boroughs, a telling sign of the city's building boom.
Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said that "with each passing hour, things get a little more grim."
At least 17 others were injured in what Mayor Michael Bloomberg called one of the city's worst construction accidents.
The crane split into pieces as it fell Saturday, pulverizing a four-story brownstone and demolishing parts of three other buildings.
Building officials estimated the weight at 12,000 pounds.
