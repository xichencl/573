 Kaczynski, the former Berkeley mathematics professor, has pleaded innocent to four Unabomber attacks that killed two people in Sacramento.
 Kaczynski, 54, was arrested April 3 at his cabin in Lincoln, Montana, and is being held without bail.
The mail bomb terrorist killed three people and injured 23 others in 18 years.

 Federal authorities believe he used bombs to kill three people and injure 23 others between 1978 and 1995.
