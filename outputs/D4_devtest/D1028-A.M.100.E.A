 In Sacramento, California, where Kaczynski has been jailed since early summer, the U.S. Prosecutors say they expect to take up to four weeks to present evidence showing that Kaczynski is the UNABOMber. Media reports said Kaczynski's lawyers requested the transfer, which was completed Wednesday, 10 weeks before his trial begins in Sacramento. Kaczynski is also charged with another fatal bombing in a separate case in New Jersey. Kaczynski is the suspect of the mailing-bomb terrorist who has killed three people and injured 23 others in the 18 years. David and Wanda turned in Theodore Kaczynski last year after authorities had mounted an unsuccessful 18-year search for the Unabomber.
