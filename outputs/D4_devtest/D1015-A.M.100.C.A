Living space for gibbons fell dramatically with increasing human population, deterioration of forest environments, and excessive cutting of tropical rain forests.
 The government has also formed a team of armed patrolmen to discourage poaching and illegal lumbering in the area.
 Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere.
It first set up a tropical primary forest protection zone in the area in 1951.
