 HAIKOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province. The project area now has 12,000 people, mainly of the Li nationality. Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere. Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China. Under the program tropical rain-forest trees will be planted, along with tropical fruit trees and economic trees. The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province and even Southeast Asia.
