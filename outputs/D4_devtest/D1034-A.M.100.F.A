Up to 122 species have disappeared since 1980 and another 1,900 are in danger of going extinct.
 About one third of amphibians are under threat of extinction, according to researchers who carried out a global census.
 "It starts us thinking that we should be paying attention to these because parallel things could happen in humans," Hammerson said.
Over-harvesting of amphibians for food and medicine is a second threat.
 The study was organised by the World Conservation Union, Conservation International and NatureServe.
 Between 1852 and 1929, one intersex frog was found in the 84 collected.
Out of 339 collected from 1980 through 1996, there were nine intersex frogs, or less than 3 percent.
