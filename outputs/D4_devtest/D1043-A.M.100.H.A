 Hariri, 60, a Sunni Muslim, was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut earlier in the day. Speaking to reporters, Suleiman Franjieh said that a car carrying explosives approached Hariri's convoy before detonation. In the press conference, Saud dismissed a responsibility claim by a previously unknown group for Hariri's assassination as "ridiculous." Opposition politicians and the United States have strongly suggested Syria had a hand in the bombing of Hariri's motorcade. Hariri, who came to office first in 1992 and headed five governments over 12 years, resigned last October. Hariri was prime minister for 10 of the 14 years since Lebanon's 15-year war ended in 1990.
