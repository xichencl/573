 The "bird flu" has claimed four victims here, killing two, including a 54-year-old man who died Friday. Although several cases were reported in Hong Kong, none was found in Macao so far. Macao residents are eating less birds these days although there has been no report of bird flu cases in Macao. The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" among chickens, apparently has been transferred to humans in Hong Kong. A 54-year-old man died early this month, and a 2-year-old boy recovered after hospitalization in November. A SAR government spokesman said the group, which comprises representatives from various government departments, will hold its first meeting Tuesday.
