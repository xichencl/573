Soedjono said that although the probe did not specifically target the Soeharto family, the investigation would cover its business dealings. A team of investigators will soon question Soeharto, Ghalib said without mentioning time and place for the questioning. Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general. Local and foreign reports have accused Soeharto of amassing wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune overseas. ``Yes that's true,'' Soedjono replied hastily when asked by journalists. However, Golkar voiced objections to proposals that the special MPR session adopt a special decree to investigate Soeharto's wealth.
