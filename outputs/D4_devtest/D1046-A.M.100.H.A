 A Chinese quake rescue team arrived in tsunami-ravaged Indonesia early Friday to help emergency aid efforts there. Japan has provided some 500 million US dollar fund for tsunami- affected countries including Indonesia, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The first batch of 100-ton cargoes was airlifted to Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, Wednesday morning. The destination is Medan, capital of North Sumatra, Indonesia, according to the China Southern Airlines that operates the cargo flight. "The meeting will be to discuss the handling of the impact of the earthquake and the tsunami," Hassan Wirayuda said. Indonesia's official earthquake and tsunami death toll rose by more than 100 people Wednesday to 94,200, the health ministry said.
