 The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast, eastern Malaysia. Puno said the hostages were reportedly taken by boats heading toward Philippine waters early Monday morning. They were taken Sunday night from lush Sipadan Island off the northern Borneo state of Sabah. Since 1969, Malaysia and Indonesia have both claimed sovereignty over Sipadan and Ligitan, another Celebes Sea island. The gunmen, believed to be Filipinos, apparently surprised the tourists on a beach on Sipadan Island on Sunday night. Norian said the armed men raided the police base on the island before capturing the hostages.
