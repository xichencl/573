 Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October. He was left for dead, tied to a fence in the 28-degree chill of Wyoming's high plains. But Verrett said hate crimes, unlike most other crimes, are meant to have impact beyond the immediate victim. He asked potential jurors not to punish his client to redeem this small town's image in the eyes of the nation. Jon Forwood, a prosecutor in nearby Cheyenne, said the university setting will probably help the defense. After the attack, Laramie found itself portrayed as a backwards, homophobic outpost of Wild West-style violence and small-mindedness.
