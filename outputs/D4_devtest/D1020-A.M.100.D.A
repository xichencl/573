 Since 1988, the number of products recalled for life-threatening microbial contamination has increased almost fivefold, according to the FDA. If anything, they argue, HACCP's inspections, which monitor things like temperature in the processing system, have helped. A recall of meats made by a Sara Lee Corp. subsidiary, Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland, Mich., began on Dec. 22. IBP spokesman Gary Mickelson said 71 retail, food service and distribution customers bought the ground beef, sold in vacuum-packaged tubes. Researchers said E.coli O157:H7 accounts for more than 20,000 infections and 200 deaths annually in the United States. ``It certainly seems like it's on the rise,'' said Dr. Robert B. Gravani, professor of food science at Cornell University.
