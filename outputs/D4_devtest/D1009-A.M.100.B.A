 ``Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey have been cooperative,'' Hunter said after questioning ended Thursday afternoon. Mike Bynum, a lawyer and business partner of Ramsey who witnessed the encounter, did not return telephone calls Tuesday. Hal Haddon, the Ramseys' lead lawyer, broke his general silence about the case to issue a statement denouncing the news articles. In the past, Hal Haddon, Ramsey's lead lawyer, has demanded police investigations of leaks that seemed to implicate the Ramseys. Suzanne Laurion, Hunter's spokeswoman, said investigators had been unable to find that information despite trying retailers, Internet sites and manufacturers. Smit reviewed police reports on the case for 18 months for the Boulder County prosecutor's office.
