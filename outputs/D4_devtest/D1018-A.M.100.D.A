 "The search is part of the investigation," said Mariaine Croes, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Caren Janssen. The man, identified by his aunt as Steve Gregory Croes, 26, was questioned and remains in jail. He beat the previous mark of 9.78 set three years ago by American Tim Montgomery. On Wednesday, investigators searched the van der Sloot home in Noord, outside the capital, Oranjestad, and towed away two vehicles. Following the approximately four-hour search, Janssen, the attorney general, clarified that Paul van der Sloot was not under investigation. Paul van der Sloot, a judge-in-training on the island, was questioned Saturday night, said Police Superintendent Jan van der Straaten.
