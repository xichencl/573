"The ceasefire is still holding," head of the Interior Ministry's National Crisis Management Cell, Brigadier Javed Cheema, told AFP on Friday. Ghani said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the fighting. He said they were camped in the open outside Dera Bugti or sheltering with relatives in neighboring towns. Dera Bugti lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas field at Sui. "This is true that some 17 Hindus were killed and their temple was severely damaged," Lasi said.
