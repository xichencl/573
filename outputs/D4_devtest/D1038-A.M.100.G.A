 The volcano is being closely monitored in part because of its cataclysmic explosion in 1980. But 24 years later, as scientists warn of a new, imminent eruption, the fear has not returned. Steam frequently rises from the crater, but the 8,364-foot (2,549-meter) peak had not erupted since 1986. "This is exactly the kind of event we've been predicting," said U.S. Geological Survey scientist Cynthia Gardner. Pam Morret and her husband, Lynn, missed the big eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. After 18 years on inactivity, St. Helens roared back to life Friday with a giant plume of steam and ash.
