 NEW YORK (AP) -- The cheering began as the parents of Amadou Diallo left the prosecutor's office. ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother, Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse. Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged NYPD critics to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade. Police officers in criminal trials have often asked for a judge to decide their case, fearing that juries would be unsympathetic. Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy left the courthouse without comment.
