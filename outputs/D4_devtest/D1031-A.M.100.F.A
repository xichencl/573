 Vietnam has in the past two years worked to ensure sustainable development for submerged forests, which face over-exploitation for aquaculture rearing. Mangrove forests thrive near the mouths of large rivers where river deltas provide lots of sediment. Commercial activity was completely banned in some areas like the Andaman and Nicobar islands and fragile patches like the mangroves. Indonesia's State Minister for Research and Technology Kusmayanto Kadiman saw off the ship, Baruna Jaya IV, at Jakarta's Tanjung Priok Port. The Mangrove Action Program estimates that there are 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of mangroves left in the world. Mangroves grow in thickets along tropical coastlines and have tangled roots that grow above ground.
