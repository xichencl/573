 "A poisoning without the poison is like a murder without a gun," Zimpfer said. ``Plus there are very few labs in the world that can accurately detect dioxin in the blood.'' Yanukovych's campaign manager, Taras Chornovyl, has rejected any possibility that the prime minister was involved in the alleged poisoning. Hospital director Michael Zimpfer said Yushchenko's blood contained more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin. Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday.
