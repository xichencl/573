 Women with low body fat, including athletes and those with eating disorders, often stop menstruating, developing a condition called hypothalamic amenorrhea. The eating disorders association cautions not to worsen the situation with admonitions like "You just need to eat!"

Mention anorexia and images of young women immediately come to mind: Mary Kate Olsen, Tracy Gold, Jamie Lynn Discalia. Some psychiatrists want to create a different label for EDNOS, calling it instead "mixed eating disorder" or "atypical eating disorder." The Tulane University-affiliated River Oaks Hospital Eating Disorders Treatment Center in New Orleans uses several approaches simultaneously in treating anorexics.
