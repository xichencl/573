 "All sides have rested and the case is now concluded," Judge Darlene Schempp told the jury Friday. Samuels told jurors that Blake despised Bakley but cautioned that her background should not be an issue in their verdict. Bakley, 44, was shot to death May 4, 2001, outside Blake's favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant in Studio City. The 71-year-old actor is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait. Defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach countered that the evidence does not support the theory that Blake shot the 44-year-old Bakley. Only two of the bullets were used, and Bakley was still breathing when paramedics arrived.
