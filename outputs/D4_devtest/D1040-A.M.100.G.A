 Blake is accused of murdering Bakley on May 4, 2001.
 ``I'll kill her in a neighborhood I'm recognized in,'' Schwartzbach said sarcastically.
 The defense established on cross-examination of Smith that the story never said Blake asked Gary McLarty to kill Bakley.
The extended recess is needed because of jurors' medical appointments.
 Bakley, 44, was shot to death May 4, 2001, outside Blake's favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant in Studio City.
The 71-year-old actor is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait.
 Closing arguments ended Friday with a plea from Blake's lawyer, Gerald Schwartzbach.
