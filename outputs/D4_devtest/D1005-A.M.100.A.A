It is a form of dementia that the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke calls dementia with Lewy bodies. Doctors have been aware that dopamine levels worsen performance in some cognitive tasks while improving performance in others, without knowing why. Exercise alone was enough to prevent the degeneration of brain cells in rats with Parkinson's disease, University of Pittsburgh researchers report. Today, a major treatment strategy is aimed at developing medicines to stop this abnormal protein from clumping. The research also identified a group of brain receptors in mice that appear to be responsible for nicotine addiction. They might replace muscle injured in a heart attack or regrow nerves damaged by accidents.
