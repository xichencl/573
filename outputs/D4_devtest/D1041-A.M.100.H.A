"We don't know if it's the algae leaving a sick coral colony or a coral ejecting a defunct algae.
 The study found as many as one-fifth of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed.
 Besides human impact, coral reefs are also threatened by global weather change.
Coral polyps absorb and shelter the algae, and as the algae photosynthesize they produce sugars that the corals use for energy.
 Farther south, scientists found that serious concentrations of a blue-green algae known as cyanobacterium are killing corals and other reef organisms.
