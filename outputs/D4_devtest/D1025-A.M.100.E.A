Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to remove Yellowstone's grizzly bears from the endangered species list later this year.
 Federal wildlife officials estimate that more than 600 grizzly bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
Stripping the bears of protection could eventually clear the way for hunting of grizzlies in that region.
 Once Endangered Species Act protections are removed, a host of new safeguards will ensure grizzly populations will not decline, Servheen said.
Fish and Wildlife Service in Montana to Interior Department headquarters, said Chris Servheen, grizzly bear recovery coordinator for Fish and Wildlife.
 Grizzly bears in Yellowstone National Park can weigh up to 600 pounds.
