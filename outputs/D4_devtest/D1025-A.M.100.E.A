 Traditional conflicts between bears and livestock are compounded by exurban sprawl creeping up open valleys across the intermountain West. The burgeoning ranchettes outside of Cody along the North and South Fork of the Shoshone River are in prime bear habitat. Federal managers contend the bears eat just about anything around Yellowstone, including grasses, roots, ants, miller moths, trout and elk. The grizzlies would continue to be monitored by federal scientists, with 10 percent of the bears always wearing radio collars. But Louisa Wilcox, who directs the Natural Resources Defense Council's wild bears project, said de-listing would jeopardize the grizzlies' critical habitat. Grizzlies don't recognize recovery area boundaries, forest management plans or endangered species politics.
