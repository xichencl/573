Opening a cold, tenacious oyster quickly without harming or slicing the tender meat within takes skill and gumption. Harvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day earns Beck just $25,000 a year. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation assesses the bay's overall health annually and rates it on a 100-point scale. Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago. In five years alone, the Maryland oyster harvest has dropped 92 percent, hitting a record low last year with 26,000 bushels. The Blackwater refuge originally contained about 13,000 acres of marshland, situated near the Chesapeake in Dorchester County.
