 The organisation called on its supporters to come to the special memorial gathering for Van Gogh in Amsterdam Tuesday evening. "Life will be a lot more boring without him," said Eveline van Dijck, a producer who worked with him. Van Gogh had been inundated with threats since the airing of the film, ``Submission,'' in August, said Ali, a Somali refugee. Another cyclist, described as bearded and wearing Islamic-style clothes, pulled up behind him and opened fire, police said. Van Gogh's hard-edged rhetoric drew criticism; he shared Fortuyn's typically Dutch mix of social liberalism and political conservatism, commentators said. Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende voiced shock and concern at van Gogh's assassination soon after the killing.
