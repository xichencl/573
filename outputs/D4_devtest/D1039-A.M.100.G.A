Officially the authorities will not comment on the motives for the brutal killing.
 Most Dutch radio and television stations have changed their schedules for Tuesday night to pay homage to Van Gogh.
 Dutch Muslim groups _ despite disagreeing with Van Gogh's views on Islam _ condemned the killing and called for reconciliation.
 Van Gogh made many enemies within the Dutch Muslim community with his often-insulting descriptions of Islam.
Despite his controversial views Dutch commentators were quick to condemn the murder as an attack against the freedom of speech.
 Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende voiced shock and concern at van Gogh's  assassination soon after the killing.
