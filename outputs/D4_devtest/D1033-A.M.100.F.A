 "It is shameful and deplorable that a state organization was  involved in illegal wiretapping," Roh was quoted as saying.
 Kim Dae-jung's office expressed "profound regret" over the spy agency's admission of wiretapping during his government.
 Hong, the publisher of leading newspaper Joongang Ilbo, was  named as ambassador to the US in February.
 Hong has offered to resign as the US ambassadorship since the  scandal emerged.
He also apologized for "causing anxiety and disappointment to the Korean people" by leaking the recorded information.
Kim, who served from 1998 until 2003, had himself been subject to such monitoring in his days as a leading dissident.
