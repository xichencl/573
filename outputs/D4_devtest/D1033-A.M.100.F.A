 The People's Solidarity of Participatory Democracy filed a petition Monday with state prosecutors against Lee, Hong and the Samsung chief. In offering to quit, Hong offered an apology to Roh for "causing concern over this incident," according to Roh's office. Ambassador Hong Seok-hyun called the presidential chief of staff, Kim Woo-sik, late Monday to say that he would resign. Roh has asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case. Gong has been hospitalized since he attempted to commit suicide nine days ago. Kim "never received any report of such illegal activities" during his presidency, Choi Gyung-hwan, Kim's secretary, said in a statement.
