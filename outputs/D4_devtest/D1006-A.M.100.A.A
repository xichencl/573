 With Vioxx coming off the pharmacy shelves, what is a patient who took that drug for pain supposed to do?
Merck's decision to withdraw Vioxx cast suspicion on the safety of drugs in that class.
The safety officer who conducted it concluded this summer that the drug posed a serious risk.
Now Pfizer's warning is sure to fuel the debate about the overall safety of these drugs for all patients.
It also shows that federal regulators often rely on drug companies to tell them that a product is dangerous.
 Merck took the drastic step of pulling Vioxx because its research showed it caused increased risk of heart attack.
