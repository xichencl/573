 Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium. In his letter to Koizumi, Howard challenged the Japanese claim that it needs to expand its whale kill for research purposes. He wrote to his counterpart Junichiro Koizumi, urging Japan to scrap reported plans to include species considered endangered among those hunted. The Japanese plan is due to go before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) when it meets in South Korea next month. Taking legal action against Japan in the Hague-based World Court was one option being explored, he said.
