"We are still working on securing the well," Statoil spokesman Kristofer Hetland told AFP. Statoil pumped cement into the production well to permanently cap it and prevent any further leaks.

The state-controlled oil company said it hopes full production from Snorre and the satellite field Vigdis will resume by Dec. 31. Its satellite platform Vigdis, whose production transits Snorre, was also closed.
