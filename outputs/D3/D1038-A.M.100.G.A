 "This is exactly the kind of event we've been predicting," said U.S. Geological Survey scientist Cynthia Gardner. But 24 years later, as scientists warn of a new, imminent eruption, the fear has not returned. Steam frequently rises from the crater, but the 8,364-foot (2,549-meter) peak had not erupted since 1986. Pam Morret and her husband, Lynn, missed the big eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. A plume of steam and ash rose from the crater of Mount St. Helens on Friday, CNN reported. Molten lava flows devastated forests and mountain meadows, creating a vast wasteland of mud, magma and ash.
