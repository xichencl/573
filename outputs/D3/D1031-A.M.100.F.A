On Phuket Island, one popular beach was piled with dead staghorn coral, starfish, gulper eels, sea cucumbers, and sea grasses. The Mangrove Action Program estimates that there are 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) of mangroves left in the world. Commercial activity was completely banned in some areas like the Andaman and Nicobar islands and fragile patches like the mangroves. Some 3,000 fishing families in the region depend on mangroves, harvesting some 230 tons in prawns, fishes and crabs annually.
