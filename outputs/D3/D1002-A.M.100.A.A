Safir called Diallo's death a tragedy but urged critics of the Police Department to ``acknowledge the tragedies that befall our family.'' Police officers in criminal trials have often asked for a judge to decide their case, fearing that juries would be unsympathetic. _ The Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau has done an extensive re-enactment of the shooting at the department's firing range. ``Amadou's blood will feed the battle for justice,'' his mother, Kadiadou Diallo, told 1,000 supporters outside the courthouse. More than 1,200 people have been arrested in the city in demonstrations since Diallo was cut down in the fusillade. Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy left the courthouse without comment.
