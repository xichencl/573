 "It is shameful and deplorable that a state organization was involved in illegal wiretapping," Roh was quoted as saying. Ambassador Hong Seok-hyun called the presidential chief of staff, Kim Woo-sik, late Monday to say that he would resign. Roh has asked the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the country's main spy agency, to launch a "thorough" investigation into the case. The People's Solidarity of Participatory Democracy filed a petition Monday with state prosecutors against Lee, Hong and the Samsung chief. Hong, the publisher of leading newspaper Joongang Ilbo, was named as ambassador to the US in February. "It is regrettable as the ambassador has performed his job well at an important time," Roh was quoted as saying.
