Sabrina Harman, 27, the other remaining soldier charged in the scandal, is scheduled for trial at Fort Hood next week. A clique of U.S. soldiers tormented Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison for "amusement," not for any authorized military mission, Pfc. The military judge, Colonel James Pohl, halted proceedings after England indicated that she did not believe her actions were wrong. Before accepting her guilty pleas, the judge, Col. James Pohl, required England to clearly describe her wrongdoing and motives. England's lawyer, Rick Hernandez, asked Pohl to recuse himself because he had presided over all the other Abu Ghraib abuse cases.
