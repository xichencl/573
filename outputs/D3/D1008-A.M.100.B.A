 Harvesting oysters, crabs or rockfish for 10 to 15 hours a day earns Beck just $25,000 a year. Some scientists and watermen say the bay shows few signs that anybody has spent five years trying to save it. By early next year, state and federal agencies expect to complete research on restoring the native oyster to the Chesapeake Bay. In five years alone, the Maryland oyster harvest has dropped 92 percent, hitting a record low last year with 26,000 bushels. The Blackwater refuge originally contained about 13,000 acres of marshland, situated near the Chesapeake in Dorchester County. Last year's native oyster harvest was about 23,000 bushels, less than 1 percent of the figure 30 years ago.
