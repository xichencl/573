Up to 122 species have disappeared since 1980 and another 1,900 are in danger of going extinct. Amphibians are often considered ``canaries in the coal mine'' because their permeable skin makes them especially sensitive to changing environmental conditions. The small frogs that croaked in Diane Butler's backyard pond had been silenced and her goldfish were disappearing. While some frogs cost only 20-30 dollars (US dollars) to treat, others can cost more than 100 dollars, Pergolotti said. ``Amphibians are one of nature's best indicators of overall environmental health,'' said Russell A. Mittermeier, president of Conservation International. "I've lived a decline," said coauthor Bruce Young, an international zoologist of the environmental organization NatureServe who lives in Costa Rica.
