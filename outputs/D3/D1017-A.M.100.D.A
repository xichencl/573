Tropical-force winds extend 175 miles from the center, while hurricane gales reach out 105 miles, the hurricane center said. ``I'm sure they're concerned, as all of us are, and they're staying in touch with emergency officials,'' Woodside said. Gary Line, manager of a Winn-Dixie in Stuart, plans to order extra nonperishables today after a run Saturday. ``This hurricane,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, ``could be catastrophic.'' At 11 a.m. EDT, Gert's center was about 1,400 miles east of the Leeward Islands.
