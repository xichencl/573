 Despite excessive pretrial publicity about Bakley's tawdry past, legal experts said Schwartzbach was smart to avoid dirtying the victim. ``I'm sure a lot of things where unclear in Mr. McLarty's mind, using cocaine for 20 to 30 years,'' Schwartzbach said. Cole McLarty has denied saying many of the comments attributed to him in the story, for which he was paid $8,000. The 71-year-old actor is charged with murder, two counts of solicitation of murder and a special circumstance of lying in wait. Defense lawyer M. Gerald Schwartzbach countered that the evidence does not support the theory that Blake shot the 44-year-old Bakley.
