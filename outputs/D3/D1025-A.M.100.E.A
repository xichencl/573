Their range encompasses Yellowstone, Grand Teton National Park and nearby lands in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Alaskan grizzly bears, which number around 30,000, were never listed under the act. But Louisa Wilcox, who directs the Natural Resources Defense Council's wild bears project, said de-listing would jeopardize the grizzlies' critical habitat. A 350-pound female needs to average 18,000 kilocalories, or the equivalent of 30 Big Macs a day, according to Mattson. ``People will see in time the states will do a good job with de-listing the grizzly bears,'' Emmerich said. Charles Preston, the curator of Cody's Buffalo Bill Historic Center, is developing educational programs that teach about bear-human conflicts.
