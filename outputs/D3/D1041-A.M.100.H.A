Reef-based activities, principally fishing and tourism, provide economic livelihoods for millions of others," said the IUCN press release. Farther south, scientists found that serious concentrations of a blue-green algae known as cyanobacterium are killing corals and other reef organisms. That means, in theory, that there is only a 1-in-1,000 chance that similar effects would be seen in a given year. "Massive global bleaching mortality will not be a 1/1000 year event in the future, but a regular event," warned the release. On Phuket Island, one popular beach was piled with dead staghorn coral, starfish, gulper eels, sea cucumbers, and sea grasses. The living polyps that give coral reefs their color wither, usually leaving lifeless white skeleton reefs of calcium carbonate.
