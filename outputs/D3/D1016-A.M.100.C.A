Soedjono said that although the probe did not specifically target the Soeharto family, the investigation would cover its business dealings. The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate alleged corruption by Soeharto as well as his wealth. Local and foreign reports have accused Soeharto of amassing wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune overseas. Meanwhile, State Secretary/Minister Akbar Tanjung Monday reiterated the government's seriousness in investigating Soeharto's wealth. Fonjallaz denied that the investigation into Soeharto's wealth was on the agenda during his meeting with the attorney general. Gen. A. Wahab Mokodongan said he was not adverse to an investigation by the Attorney General's office into corruption under Soeharto.
