"The ceasefire is still holding," head of the Interior Ministry's National Crisis Management Cell, Brigadier Javed Cheema, told AFP on Friday. Ghani said up to 45 people, including eight soldiers, were killed in the fighting. "This is true that some 17 Hindus were killed and their temple was severely damaged," Lasi said. Lasi said Sunday that about 5,000 Bugti tribesmen have taken up positions in mountains near Dera Bugti. Dera Bugti lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pakistan's main gas field at Sui.
