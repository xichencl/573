 Describing the incident as unexpected, Abdullah said it should prompt the police to review the security of territorial waters off Sabah. Officials were searching today for the hostages -- half of whom are foreign tourists. Since 1969, Malaysia and Indonesia have both claimed sovereignty over Sipadan and Ligitan, another Celebes Sea island. The gunmen, believed to be Filipinos, apparently surprised the tourists on a beach on Sipadan Island on Sunday night. Puno said the hostages were reportedly taken by boats heading toward Philippine waters early Monday morning. The tourists were reportedly taken hostage late Sunday on a remote resort island of Sipadan off the Sabah coast, eastern Malaysia.
