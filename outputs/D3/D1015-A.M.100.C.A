 HAIKOU, June 22 (Xinhua) -- A tropical rain forest project is to start soon in south China's Hainan province. Jianfeng Mountain tropical rain forest, covering more than 44,600 hectares, is now the largest in China. Zhuang says that they are removing itinerant farmers from the rain forest and helping them settle elsewhere. The forest is of great importance to the environmental and ecological protection in Hainan province and even Southeast Asia. The government has also formed a team of armed patrolmen to discourage poaching and illegal lumbering in the area. Juma made the appeal while opening a five-day international workshop on composite materials and waste minimization here on Monday.
