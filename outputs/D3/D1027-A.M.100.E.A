 Russell Henderson, 21, is charged with murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery in Shepard's grisly beating death last October. Jon Forwood, a prosecutor in nearby Cheyenne, said the university setting will probably help the defense. He asked potential jurors not to punish his client to redeem this small town's image in the eyes of the nation. ``The homosexual issue is less cut-and-dried, a little more difficult to measure,'' Rice said. After the attack, Laramie found itself portrayed as a backwards, homophobic outpost of Wild West-style violence and small-mindedness. Shepard's mother, Judy, remained mostly impassive during the first day of jury selection.
