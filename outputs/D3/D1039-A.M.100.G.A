 Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende called for calm and asked people to let investigators do their job before jumping to conclusions. Most Dutch radio and television stations have changed their schedules for Tuesday night to pay homage to Van Gogh. Some reports said the killer slit van Gogh's throat with a knife as the victim lay helpless on the pavement. Van Gogh's hard-edged rhetoric drew criticism; he shared Fortuyn's typically Dutch mix of social liberalism and political conservatism, commentators said. Dutch Queen Beatrix and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende voiced shock and concern at van Gogh's assassination soon after the killing.
