 Japan, where whale meat is part of culinary culture, reluctantly halted commercial whaling in line with a 1986 IWC moratorium. Fitzsimons dismissed Japan's scientific whaling as a cover for continuing "to put whale meat on the table in Japan." The Japanese plan is due to go before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) when it meets in South Korea next month. In his letter to Koizumi, Howard challenged the Japanese claim that it needs to expand its whale kill for research purposes. He wrote to his counterpart Junichiro Koizumi, urging Japan to scrap reported plans to include species considered endangered among those hunted. Campbell said Howard's strongly-worded letter underscored Australia's determination to fight Japan's whaling plan.
