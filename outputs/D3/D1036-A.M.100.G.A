 Yushchenko has suffered problems that affected several internal organs and caused severe back pain, according to his doctors. Nikolai Korpan, the doctor who oversaw Yushchenko's treatment, said no ``functional damage'' would remain as a result of the dioxin exposure. Hospital director Michael Zimpfer said Yushchenko's blood contained more than 1,000 times the normal amount of dioxin. Ukrainian opposition leader and presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko was the victim of poisoning by dioxin, his doctor said Saturday. Yanukovych's campaign manager, Taras Chornovyl, has rejected any possibility that the prime minister was involved in the alleged poisoning.
