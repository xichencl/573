 Earlier in the day, Hariri was killed in a powerful explosion in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. In September, Hariri was known to have opposed the Syrian-imposed three-year extension in the length of the term for Lebanon's president. The rites were organized by the Hariri family, which refused a state funeral to underscore its anger at the government. Speaking to reporters, Suleiman Franjieh said that a car carrying explosives approached Hariri's convoy before detonation. Hariri was assassinated in a huge bomb blast Monday, which also killed 16 other people and injured about 120. Hariri, 60, died on Monday when his motorcade was blown up by a suicide car bomber in western Beirut seafront.
